From the moment she photographs the corpse, which soon disappears with the tide, she is puzzled by a mystery that might easily have been a suicide, a murder, or a political plot. With the appearance of her dear friend Lord Peter Wimsey, however, Harriet finds yet another reason to pursue the mystery, as only the two of them can pursue it.</p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia to be her best work. She died in 1957.</p><h2>20th Century Ceramics (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>Potters long ago left behind the notion that pots must be purely useful or merely pleasant everyday objects.</strong></p> At the turn of the twentieth century, ceramics&#x2015;as in other media in both the decorative and fine arts&#x2015;underwent revolutionary change. The potter emerged from the anonymity of the workshop and made more individualistic statements in clay than ever before.<br><br> Ceramics have kept pace with, or even led, new movements in art, from art nouveau, art deco, the Bauhaus, and futurism, through abstract expressionism, pop and performance, to land art and installation art. Stylistic and technical influences are considered here in context, from orientalism and color theory to modernism, postmodernism, and the profuse diversity of approaches that characterizes the end of the century.<br><br> The scope is wide, taking in developments in Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, the United States, and Japan. The work of exceptional individuals is appraised, including Taxile Doat, Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, Bernard Leach, Isamu Noguchi, Hans Coper, Lucie Rie, Joan Mir�, Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, and Adrian Saxe. The relation of ceramics to other disciplines is given close attention: sculptors, such as Antony Gormley and Tony Cragg, and even architects, including Frank Gehry, have made ceramics central to their practice.<br><br> This comprehensive survey provides invaluable background and commentary on leading practitioners, critics, theorists, and pioneers, illuminating the development of an art form that seized and inspired the imagination of artists and the public alike in the twentieth century. 180 illustrations, 80 in color</p><p>Edmund de Waal is a distinguished potter, with work in many private and public collections. He teaches, lectures, and writes regularly on ceramics.</p><h2>Baudelaire: The Complete Verse (English and French Edition)</h2><p>This authoritative edition of Baudelaire's <i>Complete Verse</i> contains<i> Les Fleurs du mal </i>(1861), the first great modern work of poetry and one of the few books of poems to become an international bestseller, with <i>Nouvelles Fleurs du mal</i> (1868), <i>Les �paves</i> (1866) and all of Baudelaire's other poetry in verse. The French text is given at the head of the page, while Francis Scarfe's scrupulous and inventive prose translations appear at the foot, making this an ideal edition both for the advanced student and the general reader wishing to tackle the French original with a reliable prose prompt to hand.&nbsp;The companion volume, <i>The Poems in Prose,</i> contains Baudelaire's prose poems (<i>Petits Po�mes en prose</i>, 1869) and the short novel <i>La Fanfarlo </i>(1847), an extravaganza' written in his early twenties.&nbsp;Francis Scarfe (1911-86) was a lecturer in French poetry at Glasgow University before and again after World War II. From 1959 to 1978, he was director of the British Institute. In recognition of his contribution to Anglo-French cultural relations he was made a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres (1962), and for his work on Baudelaire he was awarded the Prix de L'Ile Saint-Louis (1966); on his retirement in 1978 he was made a Chevalier de la L�gion d'Honneur. He was the author of four collections of poetry and of the critical works <i>Auden and After </i>and <i>Andr� Ch�nier, His Life and Work</i>.</p><p><b>Charles Baudelaire</b> (1821 - 1867) was born in Paris, France. His <i>Les Fleurs du mal </i>(1857;<i>The Flowers of Evil</i>) was perhaps the most important and influential poetry collection published in Europe in the 19th century. <b>Francis Scarfe</b> (1911-1986) was a lecturer in French poetry at Glasgow University before and again after the Second World War.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Listening to Children on the Spiritual Journey: Guidance for Those Who Teach and Nurture</h2><p>Two children&#39;s spirituality experts draw on over a decade of field research to show how adults can effectively work with children to nurture their faith.</p><p><b>Helping Children Develop Their Faith<br></b><br>"A work that is enlightening, challenging, and encouraging all at the same time. It provides a long-needed look into the actual spiritual life experience of children and helps us consider how what we do in our homes and families can better encourage a growing, vital faith in Christ. It is both moving and convicting to read, and if we will give attention to what the children say, it will cause us to change some of what we do in our ministries with children and with young parents."--<b>Kevin E. Lawson</b>, Talbot School of Theology; editor, <i>Christian Education Journal<br></i><br>"Catherine Stonehouse and Scottie May have listened carefully to children, using interviews and interpreting their art, and they have listened to parents. Their conclusion is that setting the stage for children to wonder together about God, guided by a wise and skillful mentor in a carefully prepared environment, enables them to know God well and to express what they know by making room for the Holy Spirit to be their most important teacher."--<b>Jerome W. Berryman</b>, Center for the Theology of Childhood, Denver, Colorado; founder, Godly Play<br><br>"An outstanding resource for those who lead ministries with children and families. Pastors who care about the spiritual development of the youngest in the flock will appreciate the implications for ministry not only with children but with all the people of God, even--perhaps especially--adults."--<b>Diana Garland</b>, Baylor University School of Social Work<br><br>"This book is an important addition to recent literature and research on the spiritual formation of children. The fine work by these authors, long committed to the spiritual nurture of children, should lay to rest any doubts about the capacity of children to know, love, worship, and experience God in ways that put to shame many adults."--<b>Ivy Beckwith</b>, Congregational Church of New Canaan, Connecticut; author, <i>Formational Children's Ministry</i><b>Catherine Stonehouse</b> (PhD, Michigan State University), prior to her retirement, served as the Orlean Bullard Beeson Professor of Christian Discipleship and dean of the School of Practical Theology at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky.

On his side, he&#39;s got a few shambling corpses, an inept thief, and a powerful death wish. But he&#39;s up against tough odds: angry mobs of adventurers, a body falling apart at the seams - and a team of programmers racing a deadline to hammer out the last few bugs in their AI.</p><p><b>Yahtzee Croshaw</b> is a British-Australian comedic writer, video game journalist, author, and video game developer.

Littauer and for more than thirty years director of the riding program at Sweet Briar College, Paul D. Cronin is a well-known and highly respected trainer and riding instructor. <i>Schooling and Riding the Sport Horse</i> is Cronin's clear and practical guide to getting the most out of your horse in a humane and sensitive way.</p><p></p><p>Beginning with a brief history of educated horsemanship from the earliest published riding masters of the sixteenth century, Cronin clarifies the differences between forward riding and classical dressage, and how at times the two have become inappropriately mixed. He then gives an in-depth presentation of the American forward riding system that is the basis of hunter/jumper riding and examines the ways in which a rider's position and controls are essential to the training of the horse.</p><p></p><p>In the system as Cronin explains it, the three basic pillars are position, controls, and schooling. In clear language, he walks the reader from the beginning stages of training through advanced jumping and cross-country work. He sets out proper methods of early schooling of the young, green, or reclaimed horse, based on freedom of movement under the weight of the rider at the walk, trot, canter, and jump; of gaining the horse's trust and cooperation; and of establishing agility and calmness in the horse at all gaits and over fences.</p><p> <i>Schooling and Riding the Sport Horse</i> is an important book on horsemanship for riding instructors, trainers, and amateur riders alike.</p></p><p><p>Paul D. Cronin is Professor Emeritus and Director of Riding Emeritus at Sweet Briar College. For more than forty years, he has been a clinician teaching successful amateurs, teachers, and professional riders throughout the United States. Joe Fargis won an Olympic gold medal in 1984 and remains a top national and international competitor.</p><p>The system Cronin lays out is beautiful: simple, direct, humane. His book is filled with telling observation and advice that will stay with any reader who wants to improve his or her work with horses.</p> (Holly Menino, author of <i>Forward Motion: Horses, Humans, and the Competitive Enterprise</i>)<br><br><p>Written with convincing clarity, <i>Schooling and Riding the Sport Horse</i> is applicable to the amateur or to the professional horseman in a wide variety of venues in today's equestrian population. Cronin's book demystifies the concepts behind the modern forward seat and offers a legitimate system to the American horse show world to improve the quality of hunters and jumpers.</p> (Patte Zumbrun, Equestrian Director, Goucher College)</p><h2>Helping Those in Grief: What to Say-and What Not to Say, A Guide to Help You Care for Others</h2><p>Many pastors and lay counselors have had minimal training in clinical methods of grief counseling. <i>Helping Those in Grief </i>is a biblical, practical guide to pastoral counseling written by one of the most respected Christian therapists of our time. This book is the next step after Wright&#x2019;s best-selling <i>The New Guide to Crisis and Trauma Counseling</i>. Wright brings more than 40 years of clinical and classroom experience to this topic, and shares real-life dialogs from his private<br> practice to demonstrate healthy, healing counseling sessions. Readers will learn how to counsel and coach both believers and non-believers who are grieving, how to walk alongside them and how to help them find the path to complete restoration.&nbsp;</p><p><b>H.

In it, Franchi also envisions the future of news reporting by publishing companies and on the internet. Francesco Franchi is one of the most exceptional talents working in information graphics today. Although relatively young and new to the field, Franchi has already received worldwide acclaim for his distinctive graphic and editorial design of IL&#x2015;Intelligence in Lifestyle, an Italian magazine now widely considered to be a modern classic. With Designing News, Franchi conveys his vision for the future of news and the media industry. Based on personal insight and experience, he offers valuable analysis and perspectives on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the way media is being used. Franchi explores consumer behaviors and expectations that represent the biggest challenges facing traditional publishing houses and broadcasting companies as well as journalists and designers. For Franchi, reporting is not merely filing a story once, but rather telling a continuous narrative in a way that is most relevant for a broad range of traditional and digital media&#x2015;from breaking news to analysis, from interviews to commentaries, and from photo essays and illustrations to information graphics and interactive visualizations of data. In this book, Franchi explains the ramifications of this development and how newspapers can become credible, comprehensive news brands. In Designing News, Franchi also outlines a new, integrated approach for editorial designers. If they show enough dedication, creativity, and talent for interdisciplinary teamwork, Franchi sees editorial designers as playing a key role in advancing the evolution of media.<br><br></p><p>Francesco Franchi is one of the most exceptional talents working in information graphics today.

It hadn&#x2019;t yet let me go.</p><p>Outside the broad windows of the loading area, the long shaft of the Civita Station tethered the port to the ground. As they waited their turn to board the shuttles, the passengers gaped at the Earth, exclaiming with delight as they watched daylight fall upon familiar cities, mountains, curves of seashore. I had looked, once, when we took up our positions. I did not care to look again. A single glance had given me the profound feeling of falling, the gravity of the planet grabbing me back when I was so close to escaping. It was enough that we had left Earth. I did not need to gape openmouthed like these spoiled students now jostling each other for the best view. They could have been squealing schoolchildren rather than honored postgraduate research fellows, so inane was their chatter, so boisterous their excitement. They were supposed to be the best the United Councils of Earth had to offer, but they thought themselves clever for picking out cities as though they were pointing at sweets in a shop.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me when you spot our target,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;Anyone?&#x201d;</p><p>There were eight of us in the mission vanguard, four in the station and four aboard the waiting shuttle. We had assumed our false identities several days ago, long enough to grow accustomed to the uniform and rules of the Space and Exploration Commission, the arm of the Councils that governed space travel and research. So, too, had we grown used to the obsequiousness, the meekness, the smiles, all the playacting required to pass as proud SPEC members. But I was suddenly unsure of how loud I needed to speak for our hidden comms to pick it up. We had never practiced in such a noisy, crowded space.</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; Panya&#x2019;s voice was a whisper in my ear. She was stationed on the other side of the passenger loading area. Her blond hair was tied back in sleek twin braids. There was not the slightest wrinkle of worry marring her pale white brow. Her uniform fit perfectly, and she wore it naturally, with the blue-and-white SPEC badge gleaming on her upper arm. We had been greeting the Leung research fellows and directing them to their shuttles for over an hour, but Panya&#x2019;s cheerfulness had not flagged.</p><p>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; said Dag, and Henke shook his head. They were positioned on either side of the shuttle door, waiting until it was our turn to load up our passengers.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop scowling,&#x201d; I said sharply to Henke, whose expression was creased in a deep frown. &#x201c;Look like you&#x2019;re happy to be here.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the fellows glanced at me. I pressed my lips together and offered her an empty smile. The person I was pretending to be would not be muttering angrily to herself. She would be cheerful, calm, proud of her task and her uniform, never once considering that a career of such mindless servitude was an insult rather than an honor. The student gave me a vague look, then turned away to join her friends. Henke wrangled his sun-scarred face into some semblance of a grin. It looked worse than his scowl, but I didn&#x2019;t scold him again. He disliked obeying me enough as it was. I had learned to choose my battles carefully.</p><p>You have to be one of them. A speck of poison in the cancer that is SPEC. That was what Adam had said to me before the mission began. Two months ago, in the cool desert darkness before dawn, he had brushed a strand of hair from my face and touched my cheek. I had shivered with guilt I hoped he saw as pride, with fear I hoped he took for excitement. He was our leader, our savior, and I could not turn away, no matter how certain I was that he had already guessed the secrets I kept from him, the selfish reasons I had for needing this mission to succeed. He had smiled and said, Inside you will always be my warrior, but on the outside you show them a servant.</p><p>We could not take chances. The Councils and SPEC were watching constantly. If we erred for even a moment, the whole mission would be forfeit. It was one thing to risk arrest and imprisonment for ourselves if we were caught, but it was quite another to endanger Adam and the family. They were too important. Adam was too important. The Councils had been hounding him for years: attacking our compound, poisoning our crops, stealing our family members away, all because they could not abide a free man living as he chose in lands outside their control. They would have no mercy for him if our mission failed. He often said he would choose death over imprisonment if we failed him and our beautiful future was snatched away.</p><p>I adjusted my feet slightly in the straps that prevented me from floating free, and I looked over the crowd. Everywhere there were passengers tumbling, shoving each other, somersaulting away, laughing and teasing each other for their inability to move gracefully in microgravity, all of them talking at once. They were being divided into groups and slowly loaded into small shuttles to complete their journey to the Moon. There were more efficient ways to move large groups of people, but those ships were utilitarian, uncomfortable. They wouldn&#x2019;t do for these pampered scholars. The Leung Fellowship was named for one of the founders of the United Councils of Earth, the leaders who four centuries ago had come together in the aftermath of the Collapse to commit humanity to rebuilding a better world from the ruins of its near destruction. It was that work these fellows were supposed to continue. They had been chosen to spend a term in Armstrong City, and at the end of that time they would participate in the four hundredth anniversary of the First Council. It was meant to prepare them to become scientists and diplomats, engineers and politicians, explorers and artists. They were being honed for the life of &#x201c;contribution and responsibility&#x201d; the Councils imposed upon its citizens. They were said to be the Councils&#x2019; brightest, smartest, and most promising.</p><p>And right now they were trying to make each other vomit by whirling around in the microgravity. Long hair whipped, voices shrieked, curse words flew from mouths on showers of spit. I listened for the cruelty in their laughter, watched for the superiority in their eyes. They were young women and men now, joyful and optimistic, but they were training to become our oppressors. If they could see us as we truly were, their bright expressions would harden with disdain. There were limits to what Councils citizens were willing to contribute. Their claims of humane responsibility had borders as impenetrable as the walls that separated their gleaming cities from our sickly wasteland.</p><p>A voice boomed over the crowd. &#x201c;Okay, everybody! Group three, your shuttle is ready! Line up and start boarding!&#x201d;</p><p>The command came from a big man with black skin and gray hair and a voice that carried like thunder. Professor M&#x2019;Baga was the faculty escort assigned to our shuttle. A theoretical mathematician: soft, elderly, not a threat. He floated his way over to Henke and Dag. He greeted them, shook their hands. They all nodded and grinned and shared a joke about energetic twentysomethings behaving like children. M&#x2019;Baga admired the Flight Division tattoos on the back of Dag&#x2019;s hands, clapped his shoulder, and thanked him for his service. Even Henke managed a convincing smile. In that moment I was proud of how well they played their roles.</p><p>&#x201c;Group three! You&#x2019;re boarding now or we&#x2019;re leaving you behind!&#x201d; M&#x2019;Baga bellowed.</p><p>My pulse quickened as I looked over the crowd. These were our charges, now separating themselves from the others, carefree and unhurried as they moved toward the shuttle loading door. A scuffle broke out when one young woman accidentally kneed a man in the face. The man spluttered in protest and swiped at her, snagging her foot and spinning her away, which sent her barreling into her friends. The woman yelped and kicked awkwardly, caught the man on his jaw. The force of her kick&#x2014;more accident than intent&#x2014;shoved him backward into another young man, who caught him around the middle and easily stopped his momentum.</p><p>The second man let go of his friend. He turned. My breath caught. I saw him only in profile, but I recognized him instantly.</p><p>I had studied his face in photographs so many times I could see him when I closed my eyes. Black hair, brown skin. Eyes so dark they were nearly black. Angular cheekbones, even when he had been a child, more pronounced now. A recording of him roughhousing and laughing with his mother in her workshop had been played countless times on news reports in the months after the House of Wisdom incident. My own mother, ashen with shock and grief, her arms wrapped around the twins while they slept, had watched with tears in her eyes, murmuring, That poor little boy, I can&#x2019;t believe it, that poor little boy. The other women at the homestead sat with her sometimes, not understanding the depth of her despair. We were at the time newly extracted from the persecution of the Councils and the shadow of my father&#x2019;s supposed crimes, but only Adam knew who we were and what we had left behind. Everybody who joined the family took Adam&#x2019;s name, so my mother ceased to be Mariah Dove and became Mariah Light, for brightness and warmth, for the strength of the desert sun, for the fiery blaze of stars.</p><p>The boy on the news reports had never looked sad to me. He had never cried. Not even at his parents&#x2019; funerals, where he had sat wrapped in a dark blue blanket in a wheelchair, his aunt rigid and silent beside him, a phalanx of security guards encircling them as empty caskets were fed into a meaningless ceremonial fire. The cameras had remained fixed on his face. He had not shed a single tear.</p><p>His name was Jaswinder Bhattacharya. He was twenty-two years old, and he was the most famous orphan in the solar system. He was the son of the woman who had designed the engines that drove the fastest spaceships and the man who had solved the root module salt accumulation problem for large-scale microgravity agriculture. Padmavati Bhattacharya, his aunt, was one of the most powerful Councilors in the United Councils of Earth, with a position so elevated few people had any true idea what she did. Bhattacharya himself was an astronomer who studied the life cycle of galaxies, with a focus on the quasars at their centers. It was a rather esoteric and impractical field for the son of people who had done so much to propel modern humanity back into space.</p><p>He was the only survivor of the House of Wisdom massacre. My father&#x2019;s massacre, or so the world believed.</p><p>Ten years ago, four hundred and seventy-seven people had died aboard House of Wisdom, victims of a biological attack that had unleashed a fierce and fatal engineered virus known as Zeffir-1 into the ship&#x2019;s atmospheric control system. The system&#x2019;s air filters had been upgraded right before my father left the ship; the virus had struck right after. Captain Ngahere and the Deep Space Archaeology research team had accused him of hoarding data and hiding results for his own personal glorification. And, years before, my father had written a series of papers about Pre-Collapse biological warfare. It was a frail web of circumstantial facts and feeble accusations, none of them proof, but it was all the evidence SPEC and the Councils needed. They never looked for another culprit.</p><p>Bhattacharya turned his head. I glanced away quickly&#x2014;but he was looking past me, through the window to the elegant spine of the space tether, to the Earth below.</p><p>I turned to see what he saw. The clouds, the seas, the continents. Cities scarring the landscape. The quicksilver glints of shuttles and transports reflecting the sun. I had not wanted to look, and now I could not look away.</p><p>Four hundred years ago, after generations of war, famine, plague, and environmental destruction, a small group of people trapped aboard an orbital weapons platform had unleashed their payload to detonate in the atmosphere. They had meant to destroy Earth, to put it out of its human-inflicted misery, but they failed. Humanity survived. The planet slowly recovered. Governments reformed, then joined together beneath the umbrella of the Councils. Humans returned to space.</p><p>We were supposed to be proud of that. We were supposed to cherish the second chance we had been given. We were supposed to be better now. We were supposed to think it could never happen again. But those of us who had forged our own freedom in Earth&#x2019;s lingering scars knew differently.</p><p>Mankind will never change, Adam often said, his favorite opening to our nightly meetings. So we must make our own fate.</p><p>Somewhere out there, elsewhere above the Earth, our ship Homestead was already in orbit, with Adam in command. It was filled to capacity with three hundred men, women, and children&#x2014;including Anwar and Nadra, my brother and sister. My team and I had been separated from the rest of the family for over a month. They had been smuggled across the border into Councils territory in small groups, slowly, carefully, at great risk to both themselves and the family as a whole, and we had not known they all made it until Homestead launched successfully. It was an agonizing and difficult separation. By the end of the day we would be together again.</p><p>The hollow feeling in my chest, it was not only from the lack of gravity. It was not only nerves. There was, pressing outward from my lungs, from my throat, from the chambers of my heart, a giddy hope I had never felt before.

We&#x2019;re honored to have the recipients of the Leung Fellowship and future participants in the Second United Council traveling with us today.&#x201d;</p><p>The students were barely listening, but if they had been, they would hear a pilot who was calm and confident, trustworthy to her core. Unlike the rest of us, Boudicca was not playacting an unfamiliar role. She had been a SPEC pilot years before, briefly famous as the pilot of the first ship to attempt rescue after the transport Breton crashed on the surface of Mars. Horrified by what she had seen, Boudicca publicly criticized SPEC&#x2019;s response to the disaster; they responded by limiting her flight assignments again and again, putting her on shorter and shorter routes demeaning to her skills and experience. When they finally grounded her, Boudicca had left SPEC rather than accept the insult of becoming an instructor for her replacements. She soon learned there is no room in the Councils for a pilot who is forbidden from flying, so she had given up her Councils citizenship as well, turning her back on them as they had turned their backs on her.</p><p>But she had never given up her dream of returning to space. She had never given up her love of flying. There was excitement in her voice now, beneath the cool professionalism, and no small amount of joy.</p><p>&#x201c;Our flight is going to be a leisurely one,&#x201d; Boudicca went on. &#x201c;The port at Armstrong is running behind schedule, so SPEC has asked us to spread out the passenger arrivals.

Fisher cites several standard sources for his narrative, which simply restates the stark events in Homer's original. Seeking refuge in the Cyclops's cave, Odysseus and his men are discovered and trapped; Polyphemus devours several before the wily wanderer and his remaining men contrive to blind him and escape by hanging beneath the giant's sheep as they exit from the cave. Merely serviceable prose, but Fisher's paintings wonderfully convey the tale's strength, terror, and universality. The mariners and their ship are tiny against the roiling waves, Sicily's mammoth cliffs, and the giant's fearsome bulk, yet they are undaunted. Polyphemus is a muscle-bound immensity whose single eye glares from a curiously realistic face that's sure to lure any child fascinated by such monstrous figures. The play of the Mediterranean sky's lush blue against the giant's flesh tones, his fire's evil glow, and the black depths of his cave enriches the drama. A fine achievement. (Folklore/Picture book. 8+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Fans of Fisher's well-sourced retellings of the Greek myths will shiver with terror at this emotive episode in the adventures of Odysseus. The most electrifying aspect here is the astonishing art: readers' attention is grabbed with the cover painting of the hideous Cyclops and held by one riveting spread after another. The mariners' boat is dwarfed and battered by waves; the sky is an ominous blue-black; the landscapes are dramatically lit by a sun that breaks through heavy clouds. The richly toned paintings intensify the theatricality inherent in the confrontation between Odysseus and the mythic monster. Excitement builds with the interplay of light and shadow in the paintings of the doomed captives in the one-eyed giant's cave; the giant himself is so immense and threatening that the pages can barely contain him. Although the story's grisly aspects make it less palatable to those youngsters at the low end of the age range, this is in any event enticing fare.

Mature themes and an often sophisticated view of the world and how one survives in it characterize many of these selections. The mood is sometimes playful, as in Gregory Maguire's "Fee, Fie, Foe, et Cetera," or mystical as in the Native American story by Carolyn Dunn.

Without relief, two hundred whalers would starve to death by winter's end. Mercifully, an extraordinary missionary, Tom Lopp, and seven Eskimo herders embarked on a harrowing journey to save the whalers, driving four hundred reindeer more than seven hundred untracked miles.<p> At the heart of the rescue expedition lies another, in some ways more compelling, journey. <i>In a Far Country</i> is the personal odyssey of Tom and his wife Ellen Lopp&#x2014; their commitment to the natives and the rugged but happy life they built for themselves amid a treeless tundra at the top of the world. The Lopps pulled through on grit and wits, on humility and humor, on trust and love, and by the grace of God. Their accomplishment would surely have received broader acclaim had it not been eclipsed by two simultaneous events: the Spanish- American War and the Alaska gold rush. The United States and its territories were transformed abruptly and irrevocably by these fits of expansionist fever, and despite the thoughtful, determined guidance of the Lopps, the natives of the North were soon overwhelmed by a force mightier than the fiercest Arctic winter: the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>John Taliaferro</b> is a former senior editor at <i>Newsweek</i> and the author of three acclaimed books, <i>Great White Fathers: The Story of the Obsessive Quest to Create Mount Rushmore</i>, <i>Charles M. Russell: The Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist</i>, and <i>Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs</i>. He lives in Pray, Montana, and Austin, Texas.When eight whaling ships became icebound at Point Barrow, the northernmost tip of Alaska, in January 1898, a rescue mission blessed by President McKinley was launched to bring the 275 stranded men reindeer meat to fend off starvation and scurvy. The Overland Relief Expedition drafted Tom Lopp, a missionary and advocate of turning native hunters into self-sufficient reindeer herders, who left his wife, Ellen, and children in Cape Prince of Wales, 55 miles across the Bering Strait from Siberia, and drove his 300-head herd 700 miles across ice and frozen tundra. The three-month trek by Lopp and several native herders was monumental, although the saga becomes anticlimactic when it turns out that the whalers' situation was less dire than reported. Along the way, Taliaferro (<i>Tarzan Forever</i>) describes how the Lopps had adapted brilliantly to the Alaskan wilderness, respecting the indigenous people&#x2014;in marked contrast to fellow missionary Harrison Thornton, an imperious Southerner who was murdered by native peoples. Although a lucid and diligent storyteller who makes good use of period correspondence, Taliaferro isn't in a class with adventure standouts like Jon Krakauer or Sebastian Junger, and will be best appreciated by readers with a specific interest in Alaskan or missionary history. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos; 2 maps. <i>(Nov. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This gathering of eight essays by top scholars probes Morrison's novels and her growing body of nonfiction and critical work for the complex and potent aesthetic elements that have made her a major American novelist of the twentieth century.</p><p> Through traditional aesthetic concepts such as the sublime, the beautiful, and the grotesque, through issues of form, narrative, and language, and through questions of affect and reader response, the nine essays in this volume bring into relief the dynamic and often overlooked range within Morrison's writing. Employing aesthetic ideas that range from the ancient Greeks to contemporary research in the black English oral tradition, <i>The Aesthetics of Toni Morrison </i>shows the potency of these ideas for interpreting Morrison's writing. This is a force Morrison herself has often suggested in her claims that Greek tragedy bears a striking similarity to &#x201c;Afro-American communal structures.&#x201d;</p><p> At the same time each essay attends to the ways in which Morrison also challenges traditional aesthetic concepts, establishing the African American and female voices that are essential to her sensibility. The result is a series of readings that simultaneously expands our understanding of Morrison's work and also provokes new thinking about an aesthetic tradition that is nearly 2,500 years old.</p><p> These essays offer a rich complement to the dominant approaches in Morrison scholarship by revealing aspects of her work that purely ideological approaches have obscured or about which they have remained oddly silent. Each essay focuses particularly on the relations between the aesthetic and the ethical in Morrison's writing and between the artistic production and its role in the world at large. These relations show the rich political implications that aesthetic analysis engenders.</p><p> By treating both Morrison's fiction and her nonfiction, the essays reveal a mind and imagination that have long been intimately engaged with the questions and traditions of the aesthetic domain. The result is a provocative and original contribution to Morrison scholarship, and to scholarship in American letters generally.</p></p><p><p>A traditional yet fresh approach to grasping the power of Morrison?s writing</p><b>Marc C.

The play, even after 44 years, is a smart little gem, and the performance effectively captures its various moods, moving smoothly between satire and drama and always skewering the national habit of instinctive dissembling.

And not only was it sabotaged, but Levine's operation allegedly precipitated the Company into supporting a revolution in Bolivia during which major dealers became high government officials. The reason for the alleged CIA betrayal? According to Levine (author of a previous expos&#x201a;, Deep Cover, 1990--not reviewed, and subject of Donald Goddard's Undercover, 1988), the agency wanted to keep Bolivia under its thumb: The poorest country in South America was the most vulnerable to Communist takeover. In the early 80's, Levine, based in Tucson, was given a new identity, a luxury house, and a ``partner,'' Sonia Attala, a past darling of the Medell�n cartel who'd made millions arranging transactions but who fled stateside when a $1.5 million deal went sour and the cartel put a bounty on her head. Levine and Attala's mission was the arrest of Bolivian Minister of the Interior Luis Arce-Gomez- -a.k.a. the ``Minister of Cocaine.'' With Levine posing as Attala's new business partner, Attala began calling her old contacts to buy DEA-seized cocaine, at which point Levine was supposed to bust the buyers. Levine's description of this undercover work is gripping as he details the tension of big bucks and kilos on the table and of cocaine cowboys--suave yet savage--making deals while drunk and cranked up, playing with their knives and guns. Moreover, the author's suspicions of the CIA's invisible hand appears confirmed by, among other suspicious disasters, having the sound wiped off of all of his incriminating videotapes of drug deals. Flawed by Levine's endless snarling and a sometime sluggish style--but undeniably the real nitty-gritty at its core.

In a country that had never before reported cholera, the epidemic mysteriously and simultaneously appeared in river communities of central Haiti, eventually triggering nearly 800,000 cases and 9,000 deaths. What had caused the first cases of cholera in Haiti in recorded history? Who or what was the deadly agent of origin? Why did it explode in the agricultural-rich delta of the Artibonite River? When answers were few, rumors spread, causing social and political consequences of their own. Wanting insight, the Haitian government and French embassy requested epidemiological assistance from France. A few weeks into the epidemic, physician and infectious disease specialist Renaud Piarroux arrived in Haiti.</p><p>In <i>Deadly River</i>, Ralph R. Frerichs tells the story of the epidemic, of a French disease detective determined to trace its origins so that he could help contain the spread and possibly eliminate the disease, and the political intrigue that has made that effort so difficult. The story involves political maneuvering by powerful organizations such as the United Nations and its peacekeeping troops in Haiti, as well as by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Frerichs explores a quest for scientific truth and dissects a scientific disagreement involving world-renowned cholera experts who find themselves embroiled in intellectual and political turmoil in a poverty-stricken country. </p><p>Frerichs&#x2019;s narrative highlights how the world&#x2019;s wealthy nations, nongovernmental agencies, and international institutions respond when their interests clash with the needs of the world&#x2019;s most vulnerable people. The story poses big social questions and offers insights not only on how to eliminate cholera in Haiti but also how nations, NGOs, and international organizations such as the UN and CDC deal with catastrophic infectious disease epidemics.</p></p><p><p>Ralph R. Frerichs is Professor Emeritus of Epidemiology at UCLA.</p><p>"It is beyond the scope of the present report to recount the analyses and conclusions of the various studies, but this task has been undertaken systematically in [<i>Deadly River</i>]. Its author, Ralph R. Frerichs, is Professor Emeritus of Epidemiology at UCLA and the book provides a painstaking and even-handed assessment of the scientific debates that have taken place. For present purposes, it must suffice to note that the book concludes that the peacekeepers were responsible for bringing cholera. In doing so, it systematically vindicates the conclusions reached by one of the first international experts on cholera to investigate the outbreak in Haiti, Dr. Renaud Piarroux. It also deplores what it describes as a 'misinformation campaign to protect the UN and the peacekeeping program.'"</p> (Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur for Extreme Poverty and Human Rights and Professor of International Law, New York University, Report to the United Nations General Assembly (A/71/367, August 26, 2016))<br><br><p>"<i>Deadly River</i> tells the story of how the lethal disease cholera found its way from the high valleys of the Himalayas to the tropical landscapes of Haiti, months after the devastating 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake. This knowledge didn't come easy but was acquired through the dogged efforts of many investigators (a dedicated French epidemiologist, international infectious disease experts, molecular biologists, and journalists) all of whom were focused on finding the truth rather than accepting speculation or unproven theories. Ralph R. Frerichs's book is a fascinating read that also provides many insights into the strengths and weaknesses of human nature&#x2015;curiosity, skepticism, stubbornness, ignorance, pride, denial, deception&#x2015;all framed by a tragic event that has changed the lives of millions of impoverished people."</p> (John J. Mekalanos, Harvard Medical School)<br><br><p>"<i>Deadly River </i>tells two fascinating stories. One is about epidemiological and molecular biology detective work. This work justified the growing certainty that defective United Nations procedures had allowed Nepalese peacekeepers to start a devastating cholera epidemic in Haiti. The second story is about how the UN, the WHO, elements of the Haitian government, and the CDC did their best to prevent these facts from coming to light. They told themselves that they did this to serve what they thought was the greater public good. They pushed forward scientists with an academic ax to grind who had theories congenial to their agenda. We are used to industrial interests 'manufacturing doubt' about &#x2018;inconvenient truths.&#x2019; This second story shows that governments do it as well."</p> (Dr. Raymond Richard Neutra, retired chief of the Division of Environmental and Occupational Disease Control, California Department of Public Health)</p><h2>Oaxacan Ceramics: Traditional Folk Art by Oaxacan Women</h2><p>Prized by collectors worldwide, Oaxacan crafts are among the most popular forms of folk art today. This celebration of Mexican ceramics combines a gallery of more than one hundred stunning photographs with an insightful text that illuminates the artistry and the artists--all of whom are women. The fanciful, brightly colored works spring from the rich imaginations of rural women drawing on enduring religion, mythology, and themes from their everyday lives. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> tells the remarkable story of six of the most renowned artisans who live and work in villages near the city of Oaxaca. Their exuberant, whimsical creations range from the fantastic to the religious, including mermaids, angels, Zapotec creatures, figures of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, vases, candle holders, and decorative plates--all finely crafted and distinctly colored. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> paints an extraordinary portrait of a vibrant culture and its art.</p><p>Lois Wasserspring teaches at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she is director of Latin American Studies.<br><br>Vicki Ragan is a photographer whose works are in the permanent collections ol the Brooklyn Museum of Fine Art in New York, the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona, and Polaroid Corporation's International Art Collection in Amsterdam. The autOaxaca is one of the poorest states in Mexico, and nearly half a million of its three million inhabitants have turned to the craft traditions of their ancestors to sustain themselves. Among the many popular art forms, the folk art of ceramics is the most widespread. Colorful and insightful, this book profiles the top artists working in this popular craft today and celebrates the new direction taken in potteryDthe transition from utilitarian to whimsical and decorative. While some pieces remain utilitarian, others sport colorful fish or angel faces protruding in bas-relief. Bright, cheerful colors cover nativity figurines, animals and mermaids from folklore, skeletons in dress-up, and Frida Kahlo lookalikes. Wasserspring (Latin American studies, Wellesley Coll.) discusses the lives of the mostly women potters as well as their techniques and artistic tradition. The quality of the photographs and paper is outstanding, as is the price for such a well-produced art book. Although there are many larger books on Mexican art, as a single source on Oaxacan ceremics, this book is unique.

It was a tidy if dull place, where money, science, and Christian values commingled. Here Noel&#x2019;s father, Dr. Herbert Haviland Field, a Harvard-trained biologist and Quaker pacifist, set up his research and documentation institute. Switzerland, then as now, cherished its neutrality in a sea of fractious neighbors. Beneath its tranquil surface, however, Zurich was a listening post for both sides during the first and second world wars. Both the elder Field and his son Noel would be swept up in Zurich&#x2019;s web of intrigue&#x2014;the son more lethally than the father.<br> <br>A burly, bushy-bearded Victorian paterfamilias, Noel&#x2019;s father built the Field family&#x2019;s massive stone house&#x2014;the very embodiment of their solid, New England values. In the Harvard alumni newsletter of 1938, the elder Field was described by a classmate as &#x201c;one of the most high minded and pure minded men I have ever known, and I doubt that the Quaker spirit ever produced a finer specimen of mentality or character.&#x201d; Field family life revolved around this intimidating and remote figure. All Fields addressed each other in the Quaker manner as &#x201c;Thee&#x201d; and &#x201c;Thou.&#x201d; This earnest, rather austere family was singularly ill prepared for the intrigue in which they would soon be enmeshed.<br> <br>The Fields first settled in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1644. They were proud of their sturdy Yorkshire roots, and their political nonconformism. Even during the Revolutionary War, the Quaker Fields, referred to as &#x201c;between the lines,&#x201d; supported neither colonists nor the colonial power, and were thus harassed by both. Pacifism and service were the family&#x2019;s core values and, in quest of both, the Fields gradually migrated from Boston to Brooklyn over the next hundred years. In keeping with their Quaker faith during the Civil War, the family actively supported and sheltered slaves in flight from Southern states.<br> <br>Much later, Noel described himself as a &#x201c;dreamy, feminine, and withdrawn child, shunning interaction with peers.&#x201d; From early childhood, Noel was an outsider: an American in a Swiss school; taller, more awkward, and more earnest than other children. Emulating his father&#x2019;s air of moral superiority did not win him playmates. The boy preferred long, solitary Alpine rambles to the rough-and-tumble of the schoolyard. He had one companion, a classmate, Herta Vieser. The plump, blond daughter of a German civil servant, she, too, was an outsider. With her long blond braids and full figure, Herta was in sharp contrast to the gangly Noel. But in her eyes, the bookish, wistful Noel could do no wrong. Herta&#x2019;s unshakeable devotion eased the awkward youth&#x2019;s loneliness&#x2014;and would for a lifetime.<br> <br>For the rest of his life, Noel would recall a single childhood event more vividly than any other. Shortly after the end of World War I, Dr. Field took Noel, his eldest child, on a tour of the battlefields. The trip was of such importance to his father that he ordered a car from America to make the drive to the recent killing fields of Verdun and the Marne. The still-smoldering battlefields where not a living thing stirred made a powerful impression on the young Noel. He never forgot the landscape of blackened tree trunks and lunar craters full of stagnant water, where hundreds of thousands of the Continent&#x2019;s youth had recently been slaughtered&#x2014;and for what? A few miles of territory. They rested under mounds of still-fresh earth&#x2014;and left a searing memory. Thanks to the machine gun, automatic rifle, poison gas, airplane, and tank, a thousand soldiers died per square meter in Verdun, Dr. Field explained to his son. And what was achieved by four and a half years of carnage? The trauma suffered by the eleven million soldiers who returned from the front&#x2014;having experienced poison gas, exploding grenades, and artillery barrages, as well as the deaths of their comrades&#x2014;was beyond compensation. Noel took his father&#x2019;s unspoken message to heart: Do something to prevent the next one.<br> <br>&#x201c;A Call to the Young Throughout the World&#x201d; by N. Field, founder of the &#x201c;Peace League of Youth,&#x201d; was the young man&#x2019;s first political engagement and a direct result of that shattering battlefield expedition. &#x201c;We must not wait any longer,&#x201d; Noel wrote in a tract that his mother typed and that he distributed to his classmates at his Swiss gymnasium. &#x201c;If the rising generation of the whole world were to cry with one voice: Enough of slaughter and murder! From now on let there be peace! If they were to set to work and start a real crusade against war, then a world peace will no longer be an idle dream.&#x201d;<br> <br>Noel then outlined a ten-part program for the youth of the world, including abolishing war propaganda and military training in schools. &#x201c;So come and lend a hand!&#x201d; Noel urged his classmates. &#x201c;Forget the barriers of country, race, and religion, show that we are brothers! We will not confront might with might, but with the persuasive power of a great idea, the firm conviction of a divine ideal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Within a decade, the young man would find both the divine ideal and the brotherhood he hungered for.<br> <br>&#x201c;My high school days in Switzerland during World War I,&#x201d; Noel wrote, &#x201c;were the determining factor in the choice of my subsequent life. They set up my dual interest . . . to work for international peace, and to help improve the social conditions of my fellow being.&#x201d; He might have added that they also laid the groundwork for his dual life.<br> <br><br> <br>Wedged among France, Germany, and Italy, Switzerland, haven to fleeing European radicals, was the ideal spot for Allen W. Dulles, a spy operating under diplomatic cover, to set up shop in Berne, the Swiss capital. Shortly after Noel&#x2019;s field trip with his father in 1918, he met Dulles, whose name would be like a curse on Field&#x2019;s future. Dulles, two decades from becoming the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the brother of future secretary of state John Foster Dulles, was in search of local &#x201c;assets.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Field, who straddled the expatriate and Swiss communities, was known to keep his ear to the ground, a good man to know. During World War I, the elder Field routinely shared high-level local gossip with US officials. In fact, his meddling nearly ruined the career of American consul James C. McNally. Field complained to the State Department about McNally&#x2019;s too &#x201c;pro German&#x201d; attitude. McNally never forgave him, though others admired Field&#x2019;s zealous patriotism. Another Swiss-based American diplomat, Hugh Wilson, described Noel&#x2019;s father as having &#x201c;the gentlest, bluest, most candid pair of eyes that I ever saw on an adult man. They were the eyes of an unsophisticated and lovable child.&#x201d; His son inherited that candid, childlike aspect and used it to great advantage.<br> <br>In early 1918, Allen Dulles joined the Field family for lunch in their spacious lakeside home. &#x201c;What do you plan to do with your life?&#x201d; Dulles asked the reedy fourteen-year-old Noel. &#x201c;To bring peace to the world,&#x201d; the boy answered without hesitation, making his father beam with pride. The lesson of the battlefield had hit its mark. Dulles and Noel Field would meet again, two decades later, and cause each other great trouble.<br> <br><br> <br>On the morning of April 5, 1921, everything changed for the Field family. Fifty-three-year-old Herbert Field suddenly suffered a massive heart attack and died. The peaceful, well-ordered family life presided over by the aloof father was shattered. The eldest of four children, Noel&#x2014;the focus of his father&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;was hardest hit. Moreover, he felt a personal responsibility for his father&#x2019;s death. The night before his fatal attack, Dr. Field had fulfilled one of his dreams. A passionate admirer of Richard Wagner, he had talked for years of taking Noel to the first Swiss performance of Parsifal. &#x201c;In the months and years after his death,&#x201d; Noel later wrote, &#x201c;I built up a guilt complex, believing that I had caused [Father&#x2019;s] death by hurrying him up the stairs at the opera performance to which we arrived late.&#x201d;<br> <br>His father had high hopes for his bright, sensitive son. But he left the job unfinished. Noel, emotionally immature and highly sensitive, was suddenly unmoored. Full of outrage at the world&#x2019;s cruelties and guilt at his privileged status, he was now without direction or guidance. Years later, he wrote his younger brother, Hermann:<br> <br>You ask for my memories of our beloved father. . . . I loved, revered and stood in awe of him, almost as a distant, unknown and unknowable god. He was often absent and even when at home, always so busy that I was afraid to approach him (I can still hear Mother&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hush, Father is busy, don&#x2019;t disturb him!&#x201d;).<br> <br>[After his death] I began a pathological hero worship in which I pictured him as one of the greatest saints of modern times and swore to imitate him as a means of relieving my guilt.<br> <br>Of one thing I am certain: had he lived longer, there would have been growing conflict between him and his elder son&#x2014;unless I had simply taken over his ideals and sought to adapt my thinking to his. This I know: his socialism was of the religious kind and in his diary he expressed hostility to the more militant variety that I ultimately found my way to.<br> <br>At age seventeen, Noel lost the powerful figure who might have moderated his dreams of changing the world. How differently might Field&#x2019;s tragic life have turned out had his father lived long enough to harness his son&#x2019;s idealism to a milder faith?<br> <br>&#x201c;Not long before his death,&#x201d; Noel wrote his brother, &#x201c;Father had a serious talk with me about my future. . . .

It is regarded as the bible of Taoism and is by far the most frequently translated Chinese classic, with over thirty translations into English alone.<br><br>The work is said to be by Lao Tzu, who was an elder contemporary of Confucius and founder of the school of thought of Taoism. However, it might be an anthology compiled by a series of editors over a period of time.<br><br>This bilingual edition consists of two parts. The English text in Part One is a reprint of the earlier translation of the so-called Wang Pi text, first published by Penguin Books in 1963. The text of the translation has been deliberately left unchanged, because there is room for a translation of what has been for centuries the most widely used version of the Lao Tzu.<br><br>Part Two is the fresh translation of a text which is a conflation of two manuscripts of the Lao Tzu, dating at the latest from the early Western Han and discovered at Ma Wang Tui in December 1973. This is far superior to the texts previously available to us, as we have here, for the first time, a text we can be sure is free from scribal errors and the editorial tamperings of subsequent ages. Moreover, we have a text with the fuller use of particles which often rules out a good many of the conjectural interpretations by scholars down through the ages.</p><p><i>Tao Te Ching</i>, also commonly known as <i>Lao Tzu</i>, is perhaps the most important of Chinese classical texts, with an unparalleled influence on Chinese thought.

In the process of this elucidation, its author Laotzu both clarifies and deepens those central religious mysteries around which our life on earth revolves.</p><h2>The Trout Pool Paradox: The American Lives of Three Rivers</h2><p>Using rivers as the focus, an avid fly fisherman presents a unique environmental history of America, exploring the paradox between trout rich rivers and the corporations that find them useful for industry, while also proposing solutions to these conflicting demands over a vital resource.</p><p>GEORGE BLACK is an avid fly fisherman who in light traffic can make it from his New York apartment to the banks of the Shepaug in just under an hour and a half. He has written for the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and many other publications. He is the author of three books on foreign affairs.1 The Trout Pool Paradox<br><br>The state of Connecticut covers 4,845 square miles. You could fit it, if you were so minded, about fifty-five times into the state of Texas. If you drove diagonally across the state between its most widely separated points say, from the New York suburbs of Greenwich, Connecticut, to the northeast corner, on the Massachusetts line you would, in Texan terms, be making a quick hop from Dallas to Wichita Falls.<br><br>Battle Swamp Brook lies in the hilly northwestern part of the state.<br>From my home in Manhattan, the odometer records the journey as eighty-three miles, and with light traffic on the Henry Hudson Parkway, I can be on the stream in ninety minutes flat. Battle Swamp Brook is as wild a place as you can find in the state of Connecticut. Without thinking too much about their choice of words, a lot of people would call it a pristine wilderness. Pristine: remaining in a pure state, uncorrupted by civilization.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what it says in The American Heritage Dictionary.<br><br>Less than a mile from here, the brook enters the Shepaug River a wilderness gem,&#x201d; according to the Connecticut Fund for the Environment.<br>The Shepaug is the second-largest tributary of the Housatonic, which winds for more than a hundred miles from the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts before it passes under Interstate 95 and flows sluggishly into Long Island Sound. Next valley over, barely ten miles from here, just across the forested hills, is the Naugatuck the largest of the Housatonic&#x2019;s tributaries, which joins the big river at tidewater.<br><br>I began to fish this watershed ten years ago, when our kids were newborns and we rented a summer place in the town of Southbury, Connecticut. Southbury formed the base point of a triangle. Fifteen miles and twenty-five minutes in one direction took us to the town of Washington, the crown jewel of the Shepaug Valley and a magnet for affluent New Yorkers, a kind of Hamptons-Without-the-Crowds (or the ocean). Fifteen miles and twenty-five minutes in the other direction, most of it on the interstate, and we descended into the valley of the Naugatuck and the town of Waterbury, past the red-brick chimneys of derelict mills, the spires of innumerable Catholic churches, and the Italianate tower of the old railroad depot, an exact replica of the Torre del Mangia in Siena. We went to Washington for riverbank picnics, watching as the kids waded out to net giant crayfish. We went to Waterbury if we wanted to do a big shop at the mall or if the car needed to make a pit stop at Midas Muffler.<br><br>I say that I began to fish the Housatonic watershed. To be more accurate, I&#x2019;d have to say that I fished the Shepaug until Memorial Day.<br>In springtime, the river is like the Platonic ideal of a trout stream, as it rushes through places called Steep Rock and Hidden Valley. Sarah Griswold, the director of the little Gunn Historical Museum in Washington, once told me that during the thirteen years she lived in California, she never stopped thinking about the river for a single day. She told Californians that the Sierras had nothing to compare with Steep Rock. They told Sarah she couldn&#x2019;t be serious, talking that way about some rinkydink place in Connecticut. She said, I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;<br><br>It isn&#x2019;t hard to see what Sarah Griswold meant. The Shepaug is a river to break your heart. Not just because it&#x2019;s so beautiful, or because of the big brown trout and wild brookies that hide in its tea-colored runs, but because it has spent eighty years on the brink of extinction. In April and May it&#x2019;s the river that nature intended it to be, and watching its hydrology, geology, biology, and hydraulics all pulling in sync is like watching the Guarneri Quartet play Beethoven.<br><br>But after Memorial Day the Shepaug becomes a shadow of itself. As the consequence of a 1921 agreement, which the selectmen of Washington signed in a moment of weakness, their industrial neighbor, the city of Waterbury, built a dam on the Shepaug and began to divert the river water for its own needs. So in summertime the rocks bake, the water temperature soars into the eighties, parents are afraid to let their children play in the river because of the risk of infection by E. coli, and trout are found floating belly-up below Roxbury Falls.<br><br>I&#x2019;d fish the Shepaug, then, for a month or so each spring, knowing that I could almost always find solitude there, in a landscape of hemlock woods, shaded forest paths, and the scattered estates of gentlemen farmers.<br>For the rest of the year, I joined the community of anglers who stalk fat brown trout in the six-mile stretch of the Housatonic that flanks the town of Cornwall. But I never heard of anyone fishing the Naugatuck.<br>The name alone was a sufficient deterrent. The Naugatuck was to theNortheast what Ohio&#x2019;s Cuyahoga was to the Midwest a chemical sewer that was chiefly known for catching fire.<br><br>Topographically, this didn&#x2019;t make any senseeeee to me. A geological map of northwestern Connecticut showed similar granite hills enclosing two steep, parallel valleys of roughly similar length the Shepaug and the Naugatuck. It seemed therefore that the two rivers should have followed a similar course of settlement and development. Yet the divide was absolute.<br>The rain that fell on the west side of the Litchfield Hills flowed into a rural idyll. The rain that fell to the east fed an urban nightmare. One river was filled with polished rocks and water the color of Earl Grey tea, home to brown trout and mayflies; the other was filled with car tires and shopping carts. I wondered why this should be so.<br><br>From the small fieldstone bridge over Battle Swamp Brook, the trail winds sharply uphill from the dirt road. Off to the right, from a wooded ravine, comes the sound of running water. Through thick stands of hemlock and rhododendron, glints of the stream begin to appear as you walk uphill. It&#x2019;s a small brook, no more than fifteen feet at its widest, its course defined by stairstep shelves of Precambrian bedrock. Each successive set of falls is lipped with white spray; the water drops away into the next short, deep pool, stained amber with tannins from the hemlocks.<br>The pools are studded with sharp-edged boulders, long ago scattered in random patterns by the departing glaciers.<br><br>On these small, glaciated New England streams, it&#x2019;s never easy for the angler to maneuver into a good casting position. There are too many obstacles. The sides of the brook rise abruptly, and the dark canopy of hemlock branches waits to snag any careless backcast. But the fish are eager to flash at any morsel that drifts past their feeding stations, and within minutes I&#x2019;ve caught and released three. They&#x2019;re wild brook trout, six or eight inches long, with sleek dark sides that harmonize with their surroundings. The single male among them has an intense splash of orange on his belly, advance notice that he will soon be ready for spawning.<br><br>The best place to drop a fly is in the quiet back eddy at the foot of the largest waterfall, where helpless insects are funneled into a slow-motion whirlpool. This is where I&#x2019;d expect to find the largest fish in the pool.<br>Even so, the jolting force of the strike comes as a surprise. The fish is full of muscular strength, and it takes me down over the lip of the pool and into the stony riffle below. In this confined environment, with a short, light rod, I experience the momentary illusion of fighting a tarpon. But it&#x2019;s a brown trout, and a beauty, a quintessence of trout.<br><br>Those who write about the trout tend to strain for metaphors to describe its form. Yet it seems redundant to say that it&#x2019;s torpedo-shaped, or football-shaped, or anything-else-shaped. All that really needs to be said is that it&#x2019;s trout-shaped. The form is self-defining, an archetype, an ideal of natural beauty. This particular trout is fully eleven inches long, with strong, thick shoulders. The spots are bright roundels of a color that the English would call pillar-box red. I doubt whether the food supply in this small mountain brook the sparse hatches of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddis flies; the blacknose dace and creek chub; the crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, and ants that are blown into the stream by summer breezes could build a larger or healthier specimen.<br><br>Even so, the brown trout is an unlikely roommate for the native brookies. It&#x2019;s a European immigrant that came to this country a little over a hundred years ago, at about the same time that millions of other immigrants were pouring in through Ellis Island. In this northwestern Connecticut drainage, in fact, Salmo trutta has not even been around that long; the first ones were introduced here only in the 1920s. So my brown is an interloper in a sense, not many generations removed from stocked fish that swam up this tributary from the Shepaug in search of spawning grounds. In this corner of New England indeed, in most of the American Northeast this type of wild fish, stream-bred but not native, will have to be enough to satisfy our longings for wildness.<br><br>By the time the trout has revived and slid back under its sheltering rock, the morning has grown warm. Time to eat. Crusty sourdough bread, a thick hunk of cheddar cheese, an apple, ice-cold water. At the edge of the pool, there&#x2019;s a serviceable lunch table, a flat rock edged with dark, damp moss. A twenty-foot hemlock, as thick around as my thigh, has somehow contrived to anchor itself here, extracting just sufficient moisture for survival from the dense metamorphic rock. Its trunk arches out over the stream, and its roots snake across the rock face before burrowing into the small pockets of soil trapped in the crevices. The tracery of roots intrigues me, and I follow its path with my finger. Beneath the tangle, the crevices in the rock seem oddly regular, falling in unnaturally straight lines and right angles. Only by standing back a few steps is it possible to apprehend the larger shape not a table rock at all but the grown-over ruins of a milldam.<br><br>Right here at my feet is what I&#x2019;ve come to think of as the trout pool paradox. If you are looking for cultural archetypes, look no farther than the trout pool, where wild creatures of astonishing beauty swim free in the limpid currents at the base of a waterfall. The image pervades recorded American history. You&#x2019;ll find it in the first engravings of the colonists and the prints of Currier and Ives, in the hand-colored turn-of-the-century post card and the sentimental Hallmark greeting card. The trout pool is a place for solitary contemplation, for romantic love, for a sense of reconnection with lost wilderness. And yet paradoxically, the pristine trout pools of western Connecticut nurtured the most noisome and alienating developments of the American industrial revolution factory towns, foundries, mass production, the modern armaments and aerospace industries.<br><br>For millennia, before they were displaced and decimated by disease, Pootatuck Indians would have gathered their wigwams seasonally near this spot to intercept American shad and lamprey eels, and perhaps Atlantic salmon, as these creatures made their spawning runs up the Housatonic, into the Shepaug, and up this brook, perhaps as far as the small falls where I&#x2019;m standing. When European colonists began to populate these rocky hills with their farmsteads in the early eighteenth century, they found that the means of powering waterwheels was close at hand. The building of the mills followed the imperatives of survival food, shelter, and clothing. First gristmills ground the grain to make bread. Next, sawmills transformed the abundant forests into boards for farmhouses, fences for fields, and waterwheels and gears and dam planking for more mills, such as the fulling mills that would turn coarse woolen yardage into cloth. When these necessities were attended to, a secondary wave of mills made the axes, the barrel staves, the hard cider an expanding universe of farm tools, household implements, and food and beverage. The raw materials were right there to hand, embedded in the rocks, ready to spawn a growing army of blacksmiths, ironworkers, and other specialized artisans who would turn the agrarian economy of the Housatonic Valley into an industrial one.<br><br>When I first chanced upon the ruins on Battle Swamp Brook, there was nothing to tell me what kind of mill had once stood here or why it had failed. But I thought it was a fair bet that the mill owner had stood at the center of the local social web. Given their strategic importance to the economy, millers came to be indispensable sources of information, power brokers, often a community&#x2019;s first bankers and capitalists and politicians.<br>Only years later did curiosity take me to the local archives, in the town of Roxbury, where I found old maps confirming that the ruins on Battle Swamp Brook had once been a sawmill. A map from the 1860s showed the residence of a Colonel Albert L. Hodge next to the mill.<br><br>The colonel had left more than his name on a map. In addition to his sawmill interests, he was a West Point alumnus, farmer, businessman, road commissioner, retailer, saloon keeper, iron mine director, church elder, state legislator, and Roxbury&#x2019;s registrar of voters.&#x201d; He had done enough to merit a biography, and he had kept a daybook, which the public library had preserved. Reading these volumes was like looking into a nineteenth-century stereopticon. They combined to show me a three-dimensional picture of a New England valley at the end of the Civil War, quivering on the brink of a heavy industrial future because of the energies that men like Colonel Hodge applied to the natural conditions they found here.<br><br>We tend to think of the Victorians as verbose, but Hodge was laconic in the extreme. The entries in his daybook rarely run to more than ten words. While the Civil War ground on, his main concern was farming.<br><br>April 5, 1864 Plowed my garden today.<br>April 11 Sowed clover seed and rye. Snow and rain.<br>May 28 Put manure on my tobacco ground.<br>May 29 Sheared my sheep.<br><br>Yet five years after the war, the daybook reflects very different preoccupations.<br><br>June 21, 1870 A fine early shower. To the mine and started a shaft.<br>August 1 Measured the drifts [at the iron mine] and made out the statement.<br>August 4 Took up the small bridge at the mill. Logan and Perkins came on railroad matters.<br><br>In the boom years that followed the war, Colonel Hodge and his fellow civic leaders were clamoring to use the Shepaug in order to become as filthy rich as the men of affairs of the neighboring Naugatuck Valley, who had turned the city of Waterbury into the world capital of the brass industry. Hodge&#x2019;s days were consumed by the Shepaug Spathic Iron and Steel Company, which he dreamed would produce surgical-grade steel in Roxbury, and the Shepaug Valley Railroad Company, whose tracks would turn the sleepy valley into an industrial powerhouse.<br><br>But the dream collapsed. In Waterbury and along the Naugatuck, the boom and the filth lasted for another hundred years. Yet in Roxbury, Washington, and the other towns of the Shepaug Valley, the idea of an industrial future was dead within three. All that remained was the old abandoned railbed the forest path that I used to hike from one Shepaug trout pool to the next. I needed to know why, and the first schematic histories I read helped me up to a point. In this particular corner of Connecticut, I could quickly see, the symmetry between the elements of a healthy trout stream and the ingredients of an industrial sewer was almost uncanny, seemingly invented by someone wanting to make a didactic point about our culture. Over the course of two hundred years, the poverty of the land and the waterpower provided by fast-flowing glaciated rivers made this the cradle of the American industrial r...</p><h2>Philadelphia Then and Now (Then &amp; Now)</h2><p>A look at the history of Philadelphia, with stunning modern and historic photography and captions describing the development of this famous city.

Eisenberg is true only to her character's perspective, and that perspective now seems truer than ever to our own.

Using her playwright's ear for dialogue and a journalistic eye for the askew detail, Ms. Eisenberg gives us&#x2014;in just a handful of pages&#x2014;a visceral sense of these characters' daily routines, the worlds they inhabit and the families they rebel against or allow to define them. By moving fluently back and forth between the present and the past, she shows how memories and long ago events shadow current decisions, how the gap between expectations and reality grows ever wider as the years scroll by. Instead of forcing her characters' stories into neat, arbitrary, preordained shapes, she allows them to grow organically into oddly shaped, asymmetrical narratives&#x2014;narratives that possess all the surprising twists and dismaying turns of real life."&#x2014;<b>Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>"For the past two decades, Deborah Eisenberg has had to content herself with being esteemed rather than merely famous. Her stories are careful chronicles of contemporary life, unfolding from the prismatic perspective of a narrator both wise and intimate with her characters. The quality is what you might call high realism, a definition necessary only because so many other unreal states have crowded the genre. The voice is knowing, even insinuating, but there's a regard for humanity that keeps the somber cast of her stories from taking over. She writes . . . in the tradition of the old story lovers like William Trevor and Lorrie Moore, connected mostly by their pristine craft and respect for the thickness of the form. . . Her stories reveal all the steely beauty of a knife wrapped in velvet."&#x2014;<b>Gail Caldwell, <i>The Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>"Eisenberg's . . . collection of stories confirms her talent for fiction that, like Chekhov's, insinuate you right into the character's gnarled hearts, by methods so subtle and slippery that you&#x2019;re not sure where you are or how you got there."&#x2014;<b><i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>"That's how it is for the people in Eisenberg's new book of stories, <i>Twilight of the Superheroes</i>.

But Eisenberg, with her wide embrace of metaphor and keen sense of the eternal&#x2014;the endlessly renewing cycle of human puttering&#x2014;understands that behind every unexceptional face are notions and visions no one else has ever known.

The year two thousand! The new millennium! Some people thought it was sure to be the end of the world. Others thought we were at the threshold of something completely new and better. The tabloids carried wild predictions from celebrity clairvoyants, and even people who scoffed and said that the date was an arbitrary and meaningless one were secretly agitated.

We held our breath . . . And there was nothing! It was a miracle. Over the face of the earth, from east to west and back again, nothing catastrophic happened at all.</p><p>Oh, well. Frankly, by the time he or any of his friends get around to producing a grandchild (or even a child, come to think of it) they might well have to explain what computers had been.

My parents were skeptical, but I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get there. I&#x2019;d read lots of novels set at summer camps on wooded lakes, and it sounded like so much fun.</p><p>Before I left, my mother helped me pack a suitcase full of shorts, sandals, swimsuits, towels, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. books. Lots and lots and lots of books. This made perfect sense to us; reading was a group activity in our family. At night and on weekends, my parents, siblings, and I would all sit around the living room and disappear into our novels. There wasn&#x2019;t much talking.&nbsp;Each of us would follow our own fictional adventures, but in our way we were sharing this time together. So when my mother packed me all those novels, I pictured the same kind of experience at camp, only better. I could see myself and all my new friends in our cabin: ten girls in matching nightgowns reading together happily.</p><p>But I was in for a big surprise. Summer camp turned out to be the exact <i>opposite</i> of quiet time with my family. It was more like one long, raucous birthday party&#x2014;and I couldn&#x2019;t even phone my parents to take me home.</p><p>On the very first day of camp, our counselor gathered us together. In the name of camp spirit, she said, she would demonstrate a cheer that we were to perform every day for the rest of the summer. Pumping her arms at her sides as if she were jogging, the counselor chanted:</p><p>&#x201c;R-O-W-D-I-E,</p><p>THAT&#x2019;S THE WAY</p><p>WE SPELL ROWDY,</p><p>ROWDIE! ROWDIE!</p><p>LET&#x2019;S GET ROWDIE!&#x201d;</p><p>She finished with both her hands up, palms out, and a huge smile on her face.</p><p>Okay, this was <i>not </i>what I was expecting. I was already excited to be at camp&#x2014;why the need to be so outwardly rowdy? (And why did we have to spell this word incorrectly?!) I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to think. Gamely I performed the cheer&#x2014;and then found some downtime to pull out one of my books and start reading.</p><p>Later that week, though, the coolest girl in the bunk asked me why I was always reading and why I was so &#x201c;mellow&#x201d;&#x2014;mellow being the opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E. I looked down at the book in my hand, then around the bunk. No one else was sitting by herself, reading. They were all laughing and playing hand games, or running around in the grass outside with kids from other bunks. So I closed my book and put it away, along with all the others, in my suitcase. I felt guilty as I tucked the books under my bed, as if they needed me and I was letting them down.</p><p>For the rest of the summer, I shouted out the ROWDIE cheer with as much enthusiasm as I could muster. Every day I pumped my arms and smiled wide, doing my best approximation of a lively, gregarious camper. And when camp was over and I finally reunited with my books, something felt different. It felt as if, at school and even with my friends, that pressure to be rowdy still loomed large.</p><p>In elementary school, I&#x2019;d known everyone since kindergarten. I knew I was shy deep down, but I felt very comfortable and had even starred in the school play one year. Everything changed in middle school, though, when I switched to a new school system where I didn&#x2019;t know anyone. I was the new kid in a sea of chattering strangers. My mom would drive me to school because being on a bus with dozens of other kids was too overwhelming. The doors to the school stayed locked until the first bell, and when I arrived early I&#x2019;d have to wait outside in the parking lot, where groups of friends huddled together. They all seemed to know one another and to feel totally at ease. For me, that parking lot was a straight-up nightmare.</p><p>Eventually, the bell would ring and we&#x2019;d rush inside. The hallways were even more chaotic than the parking lot. Kids hurried in every direction, pounding down the hall like they owned the place, and groups of girls and boys traded stories and laughed secretively. I&#x2019;d look up at a vaguely familiar face, wonder if I should say hello, and then move on without speaking.</p><p>But the cafeteria scene at lunchtime made the hallways look like a dream! The voices of hundreds of kids bounced off the massive cinderblock walls. The room was arranged in rows of long, skinny tables, and a laughing, gabbing clique sat at each one. Everyone split off into groups: the shiny, popular girls here, the athletic boys there, the nerdy types over to the side. I could barely think straight, let alone smile and chat in the easygoing way that everyone else seemed to manage.</p><p>Does this setting sound familiar? It&#x2019;s such a common experience.</p><p>Meet Davis, a thoughtful and shy guy who found himself in a similar situation on the first day of sixth grade. As one of the few Asian American kids at a mostly white school, he was also made uncomfortably aware that other students thought he looked &#x201c;different.&#x201d; He was so nervous that he barely remembered to exhale until he arrived in homeroom, where everyone gradually settled down. Finally, he could just sit and think. The rest of the day went on similarly&#x2014;he barely navigated his way through the crowded cafeteria, feeling relieved only during quiet moments in the classroom. By the time the bell rang at 3:30 p.m., he was exhausted. He had made it through the first day of sixth grade alive&#x2014;though not without somebody throwing gum into his hair on the bus ride home.</p><p>As far as he could tell, everyone seemed thrilled to be back again the next morning. Everyone except Davis.</p><p>Introverts and the Five Senses</p><p>Things started looking up, though, in ways Davis could never have imagined on that stressful first day. I&#x2019;ll tell you the rest of his story soon. In the meantime, it&#x2019;s important to remember that no matter how cheerful they might have seemed, the kids at my school and at Davis&#x2019;s probably weren&#x2019;t <i>all </i>happy to be there. The first days in a new school, or even one you&#x2019;ve been going to for years, can be a struggle for anyone. And as introverts, our reactivity to stimulation means that people like Davis and me really <i>do</i> have extra adjustments to make.</p><p>What do I mean by &#x201c;reactivity to stimulation&#x201d;? Well, most psychologists agree that introversion and extroversion are among the most important personality traits shaping human experience&#x2014;and that this is true of people all over the world, regardless of their culture or the language they speak. This means that introversion is also one of the most<i>researched</i> personality traits. We&#x2019;re learning fascinating things about it every day. We now know, for example, that introverts and extroverts generally have different nervous systems. Introverts&#x2019; nervous systems react more intensely than extroverts&#x2019; to social situations as well as to sensory experiences. Extroverts&#x2019; nervous systems don&#x2019;t react as much, which means that they crave stimulation, such as brighter lights and louder sounds, to feel alive. When they&#x2019;re not getting enough stimulation, they may start to feel bored and antsy. They naturally prefer a more gregarious, or chatty, style of socializing. They<i>need</i> to be around people, and they thrive on the energy of crowds. They&#x2019;re more likely to crank up speakers, chase adrenaline-pumping adventures, or thrust their hands up and volunteer to go first.</p><p>We introverts, on the other hand, react more&#x2014;sometimes much, much more&#x2014;to stimulating environments such as noisy school cafeterias. This means that we tend to feel most relaxed and energized when we&#x2019;re in quieter settings&#x2014;not necessarily alone, but often with smaller numbers of friends or family we know well.</p><p>In one study, a famous psychologist named Hans Eysenck placed lemon juice&#x2014;a stimulant&#x2014;on the tongues of adult introverts and extroverts. The human mouth&#x2019;s natural response to a burst of lemon juice is to produce saliva, which balances out the acidic citrus taste. So, Eysenck figured he could measure sensitivity to stimulation&#x2014;in this case the stimulation of a drop of lemon juice&#x2014;by measuring how much saliva each person produced in response to the liquid. He guessed that the introverts would be more sensitive to the lemon juice and generate more saliva. And he was right.</p><p>In a similar study, scientists found that infants who are more sensitive to the sweet taste of sugar water are more likely to grow up to be teenagers who are sensitive to the noise of a loud party. We simply feel the effects of taste, sound, and social life a little more intensely than our extroverted counterparts.</p><p>Other experiments have yielded similar results. The psychologist Russell Geen gave introverts and extroverts math problems to solve, with varying levels of background noise playing as they worked. He found that the introverts performed better when the background noise was quieter, while the extroverts did fine with the louder sounds.</p><p>This is one reason that introverts like Davis tend to prefer being around just a few people at a time; it&#x2019;s less overwhelming than being surrounded by many different people at once. At parties, for example, we introverts can have a fantastic time, but sometimes we run out of energy sooner and wish we could leave early. Spending time alone in quiet settings recharges introverts&#x2019; batteries. That&#x2019;s why we often enjoy solo activities, from reading to running to mountain climbing. Don&#x2019;t let anyone tell you that introverts are antisocial&#x2014;we are just <i>differently</i> social.</p><p>Thriving at school or anywhere else comes more naturally when you&#x2019;re in an environment that allows your nervous system to function at its best. And the fact is, most schools are not environments for introverts&#x2019; nervous systems. But once you start paying attention to the messages your body is sending you&#x2014;such as feeling anxious or overwhelmed&#x2014;the power is in your hands. You&#x2019;ve recognized that something feels off, and now you know that a change needs to be made. You can take action to find your equilibrium&#x2014;even before you get back to the sanctuary of your room at home. You can listen to your body and seek out the quiet spots in your school to collect yourself, such as a library or computer lab or the empty classroom of a friendly teacher. You can even duck into the restroom to have a moment to yourself!</p><p>Davis probably understood this intuitively; that&#x2019;s why after the gum incident, he started sitting at the front of the bus, where no one bothered him.&nbsp;He tried to tune out the rip-roaring sounds of games and phones beeping and of kids shouting and laughing. Soon enough, he found a pair of earplugs and used the bus time to read. He plowed through the whole Harry Potter series and turned to self-improvement books, like<i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens </i>and <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>. Shutting out the noise was his way of reducing stimulation and keeping his head clear.</p><p>Supposed To?</p><p>There&#x2019;s a lot to figure out as we move through adolescence. Our physical, emotional, and social needs are all going in new directions, and it can feel as if these needs have been tossed into a blender and remixed into something different. It&#x2019;s both scary<i>and </i>exciting. While you&#x2019;re navigating the social sea, remember that even your more extroverted friends are working through social insecurities of their own. Adolescent insecurity is something we<i>all</i> go through&#x2014;even if we have an older sibling to show us the ropes, or have watched lots of movies about high school, or have been popular since kindergarten.</p><p>Julian, a charismatic high school senior from Brooklyn, New York, who loves photography, remembers feeling frustrated that being quiet meant getting less attention from kids in his grade. &#x201c;I used to be pretty weird,&#x201d; he remarks with a laugh. &#x201c;In elementary school and the start of middle school, I was ashamed of how quiet I was, so I used to try to get attention in other ways, like putting stuff down people&#x2019;s shirts, stealing people&#x2019;s pens&#x2014;stuff like that. I&#x2019;d come home and not feel very good. Now I&#x2019;ve calmed down. I try to connect to people, not to annoy them. I don&#x2019;t put up all the fronts that I used to.&#x201d;</p><p>Karinah, a reserved fifteen-year-old also from Brooklyn, often feels anxious when she&#x2019;s forced into social settings. While Julian used to make up for his introversion by being loud or annoying, Karinah has felt stuck in her own head for as long as she can remember. &#x201c;When I&#x2019;m socializing, even with someone I know from school, I feel like I just want to be normal. I don&#x2019;t want to say the wrong thing, and I don&#x2019;t always say what&#x2019;s on my mind; I can&#x2019;t always word it properly.&#x201d;</p><p>Dr. Chelsea Grefe, a New York&#x2013;based psychologist, has some thoughts about what someone in Karinah&#x2019;s shoes can do to prepare for these kinds of situations. Dr. Grefe recalls meeting a bright and artistically gifted fifth&nbsp;grader who was nervous about making conversation with other kids. The girl wanted to expand her social horizons. She had two really good friends at school but felt lost when she was separated from them. Dr. Grefe encouraged the girl to brainstorm before entering situations she knew would be uncomfortable. &#x201c;It was about making a plan and role-playing how to initiate conversations,&#x201d; she says. First, Karinah identified girls in other groups whom she felt comfortable approaching. Then she set herself a goal: to ask them one-on-one if they wanted to sit together or hang out later. This pre-planning allowed her to avoid approaching a cafeteria table full of people with no clue what to say.</p><p>Dr. Grefe suggests coming up with some conversation starters, even simple ones such as: &#x201c;What did you do this weekend?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Are you getting excited for this particular school event?&#x201d; This way, you&#x2019;re prepared as you enter a social situation and have something to fall back on.</p><p>Maggie, a college student from Pennsylvania, used to compare herself to other kids in her class&#x2014;the bubbly ones, the &#x201c;natural leaders.&#x201d; She often wondered why the popular kids were so popular. Some of them weren&#x2019;t even that well liked! Sometimes they were the most attractive, or athletic, or smart, but often it seemed more about how outgoing they were. They were the ones talking to whomever they wanted, or shouting out in class, or throwing parties. These were<i>not </i>qualities that she had, and sometimes she felt ignored&#x2014;or weird&#x2014;because of it.</p><p>&#x201c;When all the loud kids or popular kids were talking and laughing, I&#x2019;d feel like, &#x2018;Ugh, why can&#x2019;t I just join in their conversation? It&#x2019;s not a big deal! What is wrong with me?&#x2019;&#x201d; After all, Maggie was funny and kind. She had things to say. But at school, she didn&#x2019;t show off these qualities, so she felt unnoticed and underappreciated.</p><p>I&#x2019;m happy to report that Maggie&#x2019;s perspective changed over time. When she found out that she wasn&#x2019;t the only introvert &#x201c;in the entire universe,&#x201d; it was a huge relief. &#x201c;It started to come together when I read<i>The Outsiders</i> by S. E. Hinton in seventh grade,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;The first page of that book really stuck with me. The main character, Ponyboy, is walking home from a movie by himself, and he says that sometimes he just prefers to &#x2018;lone it.&#x2019; I was so surprised and happy to read those words. It made me realize that this was a <i>thing</i>! Others feel this way too!&#x201d;</p><p>As I said earlier, a third to a half of the human population is introverted.

It took place on a sunny Wednesday in June, three weeks after the man's death, just as he had instructed. Whatever had occurred before then had been private and small. Casey Ellis had not been invited.<br><br>She sat four rows from the back of the church, and a more genteel audience she couldn't imagine. There was no sniffling, no whispering, no sighs or moans or wails. Sorrow was not a factor here. This was a professional gathering, a crowd of men and women wearing the neutral shades of those who would rather see than be seen. These were researchers and therapists, present today because Connie Unger had been an eminent leader in their field for more than forty years. The packed house attested as much to the man's longevity as to his brilliance.<br><br>Casey would have bet on the fact that of the several hundred gathered here, she was the only one with an emotional stake, and she included his wife in the count. It was well known that the renowned Dr. Unger kept his spouse in a lovely home on the North Shore, where she did her own thing, while he lived alone in Boston and visited her on the occasional weekend. Connie liked private time. He disliked social gatherings. He had colleagues, not friends, and if he had family in the form of sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews, or cousins, no one knew of them. He had never had children with his wife.<br><br>Casey was his daughter by a woman he had never married, a woman to whom he had never said more than a dozen words after their single night together. Since no one here knew about that night or about Casey, to them she was just one more face in the crowd.<br><br>On the other hand, she knew quite a few people here, though not thanks to her father. He had never acknowledged her, had never reached out, offered help, opened a door. There had never been child support. Casey's mother hadn't asked for it, and by the time Casey learned the name of her father, she was so heavily into teenage defiance that she wouldn't have approached the man if her life had depended on it.<br><br>Elements of that defiance remained. Casey was pleased to sit near the back of the church, just one more colleague taking a long lunch hour. She was pleased to think that her presence here was more than the man deserved. She was pleased to think that she would leave the church and never look back.<br><br>Focusing on these things was easier than acknowledging the loss. She had never formally met Cornelius Unger, but as long as he was alive, so too was the hope that one day he would seek her out. With his death, that hope was gone.<br><br><i>Did you ever try to approach him yourself?</i> her friend Brianna had asked. <i>Did you ever try to confront him? Did you ever send him a letter, an e-mail, a gift?</i><br><br>The answer was no on all scores. Pride played a part, as did anger, as did loyalty to her mother. And then there was hero worship. Typical of love-hate relationships, in addition to being her nemesis, Cornelius Unger had been her role model for nearly as long as she had known his name. At sixteen she had been curious, but curiosity quickly turned to drive. He taught at Harvard; she had applied there and been rejected. Should she have approached him and told him she had failed on that score?<br><br>She subsequently got her degrees from Tufts and Boston College. The latter was a master's in social work -- not quite the Ph.D. Cornelius had, but she counseled clients as he did, and now she even had an offer to teach. She didn't know if she would take it, but that was another issue. She loved counseling. She imagined her father had, too, if his dedication meant anything. Over the years she had read virtually everything he had written, attended every open lecture he gave, clipped every review of his work. He saw therapy as a scavenger hunt, with clues hidden in the various "rooms" of one's life. He advocated talk therapy to ferret them out -- an irony, since by all reports the man couldn't carry on a social conversation for beans -- but he knew the right questions to ask.<br><br>That was what therapy was about, he lectured -- asking the right questions. Listening, then asking questions that pointed the patient in the right direction so that he could find the answer for himself.<br><br>Casey was quite good at that, judging from the growth of her practice. The people she knew here today were her own colleagues. She had studied with them, shared office space, attended workshops, and consulted with them. They respected her as a counselor, enough to make their referrals a significant source of her clientele. These colleagues were oblivious to any connection between her and the deceased.<br><br>The warmth of June remained outside on the steps of the church. Inside, the sun's rays were reduced to muted shards of color cast from the stained glass high atop the stone, and the air was comfortably cool, smelling of history as relics of the Revolutionary War did. Casey loved that smell. It gave her the sense of history that her life lacked.<br><br>She took comfort in that as one speaker after another filed to the front of the church, but they said nothing Casey didn't already know. Professionally, Connie Unger had been loved. His taciturnity was alternately viewed as shyness or pensiveness, his refusal to attend department parties as a sweet, social awkwardness. At some point in his career, people had taken to protecting him. Casey had often wondered whether his lack of a personal life helped that along. In the absence of friends, his colleagues felt responsible for him.<br><br>The service ended and people began to file out of the church; like Casey, they were headed back to work. She smiled at one friend, hitched her chin at another, paused briefly on the front steps to talk with the man who had been her thesis adviser, returned a hug when a passing colleague leaned in. Then she stopped again, this time at the behest of one of her partners.<br><br>There were five partners in the group. John Borella was the only psychiatrist. Of the other four, two were Ph.D. therapists. Casey and one other had their master's in social work.<br><br>"We have to meet later," the psychiatrist said.<br><br>Casey wasn't concerned by the urgency in his voice. John was a chronic alarmist. "My day is tight," she warned.<br><br>"Stuart's gone."<br><br>That gave her pause. Stuart Bell was one of the Ph.D. therapists. More important, he paid the office bills.<br><br>"What do you mean, 'gone'?" she asked cautiously.<br><br>"Gone," John repeated, speaking lower now. "His wife called me a little while ago. She came home from work last night to an empty house -- empty drawers, empty closets, empty bank book. I checked his office. Same thing."<br><br>Casey was startled. "His files?"<br><br>"Gone."<br><br>Her startled reaction grew to appalled. <i>"Our</i> bank account?"<br><br>"Empty."<br><br>"Aeyyyy." She felt a touch of panic. "Okay. We'll talk later."<br><br>"He has the rent money."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"Seven months' worth."<br><br>"Yes." Casey had given Stuart a check for her share on the first of each of those seven months. They had learned the week before that the rent hadn't been paid for any of those months. When confronted, Stuart had claimed it was a simple oversight, lost in the mounds of paperwork that had taken over so much of their time -- and they understood, because they all knew how that went. He had promised to pay it in full.<br><br>"It's due next week," John reminded Casey now.<br><br>They would have to come up with the money. The alternative was eviction. But Casey couldn't discuss eviction now. She couldn't even <i>think</i> about it with Cornelius Unger watching and listening. "This isn't the time or the place, John. Let's talk later."<br><br>"Excuse me?" said a slim, gray-haired gentleman in a navy suit who had come down the steps of the church as the crowd thinned. "Miss Ellis?"<br><br>As John moved on, Casey turned to the newcomer.<br><br>"I'm Paul Winnig," he said. "I was Dr. Unger's lawyer. I'm the executor of his estate. Could we talk for a minute?"<br><br>She would have asked what the executor of Dr. Unger's estate wanted with her, if the lawyer's eyes hadn't answered the question. Yes, he did know who she was.<br><br>Surprised by that awareness and quickly unsettled, she managed, "Uh, of course. Whenever."<br><br>"Now would be good."<br><br>"Now?" She glanced at her watch and felt a trace of annoyance. She didn't know whether her father kept clients waiting. She did not. "I have an appointment in thirty minutes."<br><br>"This will only take five," the lawyer said. With a light hand at her elbow, he gently guided her down the steps and onto a narrow stone path that led around the side of the church.<br><br>Casey's heart was beating hard. Before she could even begin to wonder what he had to say, or what she felt about his saying anything at all, the path opened into a small courtyard out of sight of the street. Releasing her elbow, the lawyer gestured her to a wrought-iron bench. When they were both seated, he said, "Dr. Unger left instructions that you should be contacted as soon as the memorial service was done."<br><br>"I don't know why," Casey remarked, having recovered a bit of composure. "He had no interest in me at all."<br><br>"I believe you're wrong," the lawyer chided. He pulled an envelope from the pocket of his suit jacket. It was a small manila thing the size of an index card, with a clasp at the top.<br><br>Casey stared at the envelope.<br><br>The lawyer held it up to show her the front. "It has your name on it."<br><br>So it did -- "Cassandra Ellis," written in the same shaky scrawl she had seen dozens of times in margin notes on the graphs and charts that Connie Unger projected onto screens during lectures.<br><br><i>Cassandra Ellis.</i> Her name, written by her father. It was a first.<br><br>Her heart began to rap against her ribs. Her eyes returned to the lawyer's. Apprehensive, not quite knowing what she wanted to find in the envelope but fearing that whatever it was, it wouldn't be there, she gingerly reached out. The envelope was lumpy.<br><br>"There's a key inside," Paul Winnig explained. "Dr. Unger left you his townhouse."<br><br>Casey frowned, pulled in her chin, regarded the lawyer with doubt. When he nodded, she dropped her eyes to the envelope. Carefully, she unfolded the clasp, raised the small flap, and looked inside. She tipped out a key, then pulled out a piece of paper that had been folded over many times to fit. In the seconds it took to unfold it -- several seconds longer than it might have taken had her hands been steadier -- her fantasy flared. In those seconds, she imagined a warm little note. It didn't have to be long. It could be as simple as, <i>You are my daughter, Casey. I've watched you all these years. You've made me proud.</i><br><br>There was in fact writing on the paper, but the message was succinct. She saw the address of the townhouse. She saw an alarm code. She saw a short list of names beside words like "plumber," "painter," and "electrician." The names of the gardener and the maid had asterisks beside them.<br><br>"Dr. Unger would like the gardener and maid retained," the lawyer explained. "In the end it's your choice, but he felt that both were good and that they loved the house as much as he did."<br><br>Casey was stunned. There was absolutely nothing of a personal nature on the paper. "He loved the house?" she echoed, hurt, and met the lawyer's gaze. "A house is a thing. Did he ever love <i>people?"</i><br><br>Paul Winnig smiled sadly. "In his way."<br><br>"What way was that?"<br><br>"Silently. Distantly."<br><br>"Absently?" Casey charged, torn in that instant, of half a mind to ball up the paper and toss it away. She was angry that her father hadn't said something to her in life, angry that the note contained nothing she longed to read. "What if I don't want his townhouse?"<br><br>"If you don't want it, sell it. It's worth three million. That's your legacy, Ms. Ellis."<br><br>Casey didn't doubt the value of the house. It sat in a coveted spot in Leeds Court, itself a coveted spot on Beacon Hill. She had been past it many times. In not one of those passes, though, had the idea that she might one day own it ever crossed her mind.<br><br>"Have you ever been inside?" the lawyer asked.<br><br>"No."<br><br>"It's a beautiful place."<br><br>"I already have a place."<br><br>"You could sell that one."<br><br>"And take on a larger mortgage?"<br><br>"There's no mortgage here. Dr. Unger owned the townhouse outright."<br><br>And he was giving it to Casey? A three-million-dollar home that was all paid for? There had to be a catch. "Upkeep, then -- heat, air-conditioning. And taxes -- property taxes alone are probably twice my yearly mortgage payments."<br><br>"There's a trust fund for taxes. And for the household help. There's also parking, two spaces in back with private access, two on the Court itself, all paid for. As for heat and the rest, he had the confidence that you could handle those yourself."<br><br>She certainly could -- or could have, if Stuart Bell hadn't absconded with seven months' rent. "Why?"<br><br>"Why what?"<br><br>"Why is he doing this? Why such a lavish gift after nothing all these years?"<br><br>"I don't know the answer to that."<br><br>"Does his wife know that he's given me this?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And she doesn't object?"<br><br>"No. She was never part of the townhouse. She made out very well in his will without it."<br><br>"How long has she known about me?"<br><br>"A while."<br><br>Casey felt a stab of bitterness. "And she couldn't call me herself to tell me about his death? I had to read it in the paper. That didn't feel good."<br><br>"I'm sorry."<br><br>"Did he order her not to contact me?"<br><br>The lawyer sighed, seeming to weary a bit. "I don't know that. Your father was a complicated man. I don't think any of us knew who he was inside. Ruth -- his wife -- came as close as anyone did, but you know how they lived."<br><br>Casey did. She didn't know whether she felt worse for her own mother, who had lost Connie Unger before she ever had him, or for Connie's wife, who once had had him but lost him.<br><br>"Seems to me," Casey declared, "that the man was no bargain."<br><br>"Maybe not," the lawyer replied and rose. "In any event, the house is yours. Everything's been transferred to your name. I'll have a courier deliver the papers to you tomorrow. I'd suggest you put them in a vault."<br><br>Casey remained seated. "I don't have a vault."<br><br>"I do. Would you like me to hold them for you?"<br><br>"Please."<br><br>Winnig pulled a business card from his pocket. "Here's where I am."<br><br>Casey took the card. "What about his...things? Are they all there?"<br><br>"Personal things, yes. He arranged for Emmett Walsh to take over his practice, so the computer, client files, and Rolodex have all gone to him."<br><br>A distant little bubble burst. From time to time, it had held a dream. As the dream went, one day Connie would come to respect her as a professional, enough to refer clients to her. Even make her his prot�g�e. <i>Even</i> invite her to share his practice, making it a father-daughter group.<br><br>The disappointment was brief. The dream, after all, had never received an ounce of encouragement. "Ah," she managed. Still, she didn't rise.<br><br>"You look pale," the lawyer said. "Are you all right?"<br><br>She nodded. "Just a little startled."<br><br>He smiled. "Run over and take a look inside the place. It has a certain charm."<br><br>Casey couldn't go that day. She saw clients straight through until eight, at which time she pushed the issue of the townhouse farther back in her mind and joined her partners in the conference room.

But when the letter&#x2014;which will heal a centuries-old rift between England and the Betrovians&#x2014;is stolen out from under Evaline and Mina's watchful eyes, the two girls are forced into a high-stakes race to ensure they find the chess queen before anyone else does.</p><p>Colleen Gleason is the award-winning, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of more than two dozen novels, including the Stoker &amp; Holmes series and the international bestselling Gardella Vampire Chronicles. She lives in the Midwest.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;A mere three weeks have passed since Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes solved The Case of the Spiritglass Charade (Chronicle, 2014). When a letter revealing the location of missing royal chess piece is stolen, it is up to the plucky teens to find it before their lethal nemesis, the Ankh, does. The chess piece is the key to a royal chessboard, one that holds jewels and invaluable secrets. In the wrong hands, the secrets could turn deadly. The teens' forays are complicated by the fact that Princess Alix expects them to chaperone the demure Princess Lurelia of Betrovia, who is visiting Britain on a goodwill trip. As in the previous titles, the narrative alternates between the viewpoints of the distinctly different Evaline and Mina. The variations in their observations give insight into their characters and the time period. Evaline, for instance, cherishes her role as an undercover kick-arse vampire hunter. She loves her "Angel in the House" sister-in-law but chafes at that relative's efforts to see her courted and married off. Mina longs to satisfy her sleuthing instincts but worries about what society will think of her. Red herrings whiz back and forth like steam-powered bullets as the friends work their way through fancy dress balls, dusty museums, and creepy laboratories to solve the mystery. VERDICT The endearingly flawed and delightfully competent heroines, the convincing integration of steampunk accoutrements, and the fact-based historical framework make this a must-purchase where the other novels are popular.&#x2014;Jennifer Prince, Buncombe County Public Libraries, NC</p><h2>Dorrie and the Museum Case</h2><p>With the help of her cousin Cosmo, Dorrie, the little witch, thwarts the scheme of Giblett the Enchanter on the opening day of the Witchville Museum.</p><p>Grade 1-4 Dorrie the little witch doesn't always do things the way she should, but somehow events usually become resolved in a satisfactory manner.

With her ocean-going rowing shell and her husband, Doug Fesler, in a small boat of his own, she has disappeared every summer for years, exploring the rugged shorelines of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Spitsbergen, and Norway. Carrying what they need to be self-sufficient, the two of them have battled mountainous seas and hurricane-force winds, dragged their boats across jumbles of ice, fended off grizzlies and polar bears, been serenaded by humpback whales and scrutinized by puffins, and reveled in moments of calm.<br> <br>As Fredston writes, these trips are "neither a vacation nor an escape, they are a way of life." Rowing to Latitude is a lyrical, vivid celebration of these northern journeys and the insights they inspired. It is a passionate testimonial to the extraordinary grace and fragility of wild places, the power of companionship, the harsh but liberating reality of risk, the lure of discovery, and the challenges and joys of living an unconventional life.<br></p><p><b>Jill Fredston</b> and her husband, <b>Doug Fesler</b>, are avalanche experts and co-directors of the Alaska Mountain Safety Center. When they are not rowing, they live near Anchorage.<br>Rowing to Latitude <br> I wish to speak a word for nature, for <i>absolute freedom and wildness.</i> --Henry David Thoreau, "Walking" Preface FOR YEARS my husband, Doug Fesler, and I have led a double life. In the winter, we work together as avalanche specialists. Then, with the lighter days of summer, we disappear (though my mother hates that word) on three-to-five-month-long wilderness rowing and kayaking trips. Somehow, more than twenty thousand miles have slid under our blades, a function of time and repetitive motion rather than undue strength or bravery. Once, far down the Yukon River, which begins in western Canada and cleaves Alaska, an old Athabascan subsistence fisherman hailed us from his aluminum skiff. In keeping with local custom, he was in no hurry to talk, preferring to drift in silence while his eyes appraised us through a poker mask of wrinkles. In time he asked, "Where you come from?" And a minute or two later, "Where you go?" More silence, while he digested our answers. Eventually he pronounced, "You must be plenty rich tospend the summer paddling." Doug leaned back, grinned, and replied without a trace of the awkwardness I feared was lit in neon upon my face, "If we were rich, we'd have a boat with a motor like yours." Though we are far from rich and occasionally prey to bouts of motor envy, paddling is our preferred mode of travel, at least until our joints completely disintegrate. It allows us to tickle the shoreline, and opens our senses to the rhythms around us. We are more attuned to our surroundings when we are moving at only five miles per hour, maybe six on a good day. With hours to think, it is also a little harder to escape from ourselves. We always travel in two boats. This gives us an extra margin of safety and allows us to carry several months' worth of supplies. More important, such separation keeps us from hating each other. It would take better people than we are to share a small boat day after day and then to crawl into the same tent night after night, for weeks on end. Until 1994, there was also the practical consideration that we propelled our boats differently. I am firmly committed to rowing, which does not allow any part of my body to ride for free. My legs, when confined by the spray skirt of a kayak, instantly begin to twitch, and my arms feel cast in bronze. Doug favored kayaking for the first thirteen thousand of the miles we journeyed together; oddly, he thought it was important to see where he was going. But at last he converted, reluctantly acknowledging the greater efficiency and speed afforded by a sliding seat and long oars. Onlookers frequently remark that they would love to do similar trips if only they had the time, or the necessary experience. No matter how often I've heard these comments, they still give me pause. As for time, we give it a high priority; if we wait too long, we will be unable to row. And we've gained the experience by doing, stroke by stroke. Most often, though, people question why we undertake these trips at all. They might as well ask us why we breathe or eat. Our journeys are food for our spirits, clean air for our souls. We don't care if they are firsts or farthests; we don't seek sponsors. They are neither a vacation nor an escape, they are a way of life. On a trip down the Yukon River in 1987, we made a habit of asking Native people who lived along its shores how far up- and downriver they had traveled. Usually they had ranged less than fifty miles in either direction--some a little farther in these days of snowmachines and skiffs with hefty outboard engines. Just over halfway down the river, however, at about the twelve-hundred-mile mark, we met Uncle Al, an Athabascan elder. He was slightly stooped with age but straightened when he answered, brown eyes aglow. As a young man, he said, he had traveled by canoe all the way to the headwater lakes, and had also followed the river a thousand miles from his home to the sea. When we asked why, he looked puzzled. "I had to know where the river came from and where it was going." We give a version of the same answer. We do these trips because we need to. The world of phones, computers, and deadlines cannot compare with singing birds, breaching whales, magnificent light shows, and crackling ice. If, on the day I took possession of my first ocean shell from the canopy of a dusty truck, someone had informed me that I would row more than enough miles to take me to the far side of the world and back, I would have marveled at the notion. As with most burgeoning ventures, this book also began innocently, as a holiday letter sent annually to friends, family, and those who had helped us along the way. The letters were evidently passed along through a maze of unseen channels. Before long, we began to receive requests from people we'd never heard of to add their names to our mailing list. If laziness or a hectic avalanche season caused us to miss a year, we'd end up fielding phone calls fromobscure corners of the world from people who were sure we had met one too many polar bears. Still, I shared the skepticism of the round-faced Inupiaq man who, weary of passing visitors to the Arctic declaring themselves instant experts, invited us to his house for whale blubber only after I had assured him in good faith that I was not writing a book. It was not until our stories began to take on a life of their own--retold to us by people unaware of their origins and unlikely ever to find themselves experiencing the expanse of the Arctic firsthand--that the stirrings of the book within became much harder to ignore. In the last few years, I've felt increasing urgency to give voice to the caribou that graze without fear along the Labrador shore, to the wide-shouldered brown bears of the Alaska Peninsula who depend upon the annual migration of salmon, to fjords uncut by roads or power lines. Doug and I are drawn to northern latitudes not out of sheer perversity, as our families claim, but because we seek wild country. The prevailing nasty weather of the sub-Arctic and Arctic can be a great deterrent to both dense settlement and tourism. But during our travels, we've witnessed the lengthening shadow of our civilization's influence over remote corners of the natural world. What finally galvanized me into writing, though, was an even more tangible reminder of the fragility of all that surrounds us. When my mother was diagnosed with advanced cancer, she said, "You have to write this book before I die." I responded, "All right, but you have to live a long time." In the process of journeying, we seem to have become the journey, blurring the boundaries between the physical landscape outside of ourselves and the spiritual landscape within. Once, during a long crossing in Labrador, we found ourselves in fog so thick that it was impossible to see even the ends of our boats. Unable to distinguish gray water from gray air, I felt vertigo grabhold of my equilibrium, and the world began to spin. I needed a reference point--the sound of Doug's voice or the catch of my blades as they entered the water--to know which way was right side up. Rounding thousands of miles of ragged shoreline together, driven by the joys and fears of not knowing what lies around the next bend, has helped us to find an interior compass. Doug and I have awoken many Alaska winter mornings inside cabins so fogged with the warm vapor of our dreams that we couldn't tell if the dark shape outside the window was a moose or a tree. To bring the object outside into clearer view, we had to start within, scraping a hole in the frost with our fingernails. This book begins much the same way. <i>Copyright � 2001 by Jill Fredston</i></p><h2>The Walking Dead: The Road to Woodbury</h2><p>2013 TV tie-in trade edition paperback new condition.

She shivers in her bulky Georgia Tech sweatshirt, antique jewelry, and ripped jeans. Ruddy and freckled, with long, deep brown hair that dangles in tendrils wound with delicate little feathers, Lilly Caul is a bundle of nervous tics, from the constant yanking of stray wisps of hair back behind her ears to the compulsive gnawing of fingernails. Now, with her small hand she clutches the hammer tighter and repeatedly whacks at the metal stake, grazing the head as if the thing is greased.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Lilly, just relax,&#x201d; the big man says, looking on from behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;A two-year-old could do this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop beating yourself up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me I want to beat up.&#x201d; She pounds some more, two-handing the hammer. The stake goes nowhere. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s this stupid stake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re choked up too high on the hammer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Move your hand more toward the end of the handle, let the tool do the work.&#x201d;</p><p>More pounding.</p><p>The stake jumps off hard ground, goes flying, and lands ten feet away.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it!

Lilly recoils, refusing to hand over the implement. &#x201c;Give me a second, okay? I can handle this, I can,&#x201d; she insists, her narrow shoulders tensing under the sweatshirt.</p><p>She grabs another stake and starts again, tapping the metal crown tentatively. The ground resists, as tough as cement. It&#x2019;s been a cold October so far, and the fallow fields south of Atlanta have hardened. Not that this is a bad thing. The tough clay is also porous and dry&#x2014;for the moment at least&#x2014;hence the decision to pitch camp here. Winter&#x2019;s coming, and this contingent has been regrouping here for over a week, settling in, recharging, rethinking their futures&#x2014;if indeed they have any futures.</p><p>&#x201c;You kinda just let the head fall on it,&#x201d; the burly African-American demonstrates next to her, making swinging motions with his enormous arm. His huge hands look as though they could cover her entire head. &#x201c;Use gravity and the weight of the hammer.&#x201d;</p><p>It takes a great deal of conscious effort for Lilly not to stare at the black man&#x2019;s arm as it pistons up and down. Even crouching in his sleeveless denim shirt and ratty down vest, Josh Lee Hamilton cuts an imposing figure. Built like an NFL tackle, with monolithic shoulders, enormous tree-trunk thighs, and thick neck, he still manages to carry himself quite gently. His sad, long-lashed eyes and his deferential brow, which perpetually creases the front of his balding pate, give off an air of unexpected tenderness. &#x201c;No big deal&nbsp;... see?&#x201d; He shows her again and his tattooed bicep&#x2014;as big as a pig&#x2019;s belly&#x2014;jumps as he wields the imaginary hammer. &#x201c;See what I&#x2019;m sayin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>Lilly discreetly looks away from Josh&#x2019;s rippling arm. She feels a faint frisson of guilt every time she notices his muscles, his tapered back, his broad shoulders. Despite the amount of time they have been spending together in this hell-on-earth some Georgians are calling &#x201c;the Turn,&#x201d; Lilly has scrupulously avoided crossing any intimate boundaries with Josh. Best to keep it platonic, brother-and-sister, best buds, nothing more. Best to keep it strictly business&nbsp;... especially in the midst of this plague.</p><p>But that has not stopped Lilly from giving the big man coy little sidelong grins when he calls her &#x201c;girlfriend&#x201d; or &#x201c;babydoll&#x201d;&nbsp;... or making sure he gets a glimpse of the Chinese character tattooed above Lilly&#x2019;s tailbone at night when she&#x2019;s settling into her sleeping bag. Is she leading him on? Is she manipulating him for protection? The rhetorical questions remain unanswered.</p><p>For Lilly the embers of fear constantly smoldering in her gut have cauterized all ethical issues and nuances of social behavior. In fact, fear has dogged her off and on for most her life&#x2014;she developed an ulcer in high school, and had to be on antianxiety meds during her aborted tenure at Georgia Tech&#x2014;but now it simmers constantly inside her. The fear poisons her sleep, clouds her thoughts, presses in on her heart. The fear makes her do things.</p><p>She seizes the hammer so tightly now it makes the veins twitch in her wrist.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not rocket science ferchrissake!&#x201d; she barks, and finally gets control of the hammer and drives a stake into the ground through sheer rage. She grabs another stake. She moves to the opposite corner of the canvas, and then wills the metal bit straight through the fabric and into the ground by pounding madly, wildly, missing as many blows as she connects. Sweat breaks out on her neck and brow. She pounds and pounds. She loses herself for a moment.</p><p>At last she pauses, exhausted, breathing hard, greasy with perspiration.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay&nbsp;... that&#x2019;s one way to do it,&#x201d; Josh says softly, rising to his feet, a smirk on his chiseled brown face as he regards the half-dozen stakes pinning the canvas to the ground. Lilly says nothing.</p><p>The zombies, coming undetected through the trees to the north, are now less than five minutes away.</p><p>Not a single one of Lilly Caul&#x2019;s fellow survivors&#x2014;numbering close to a hundred now, all grudgingly banding together to try and build a ragtag community here&#x2014;realizes the one fatal drawback to this vacant rural lot in which they&#x2019;ve erected their makeshift tents.</p><p>At first glance, the property appears to be ideal. Situated in a verdant area fifty miles south of the city&#x2014;an area that normally produces millions of bushels of peaches, pears, and apples annually&#x2014;the clearing sits in a natural basin of seared crabgrass and hard-packed earth. Abandoned by its onetime landlords&#x2014;probably the owners of the neighboring orchards&#x2014;the lot is the size of a soccer field. Gravel drives flank the property. Along these winding roads stand dense, overgrown walls of white pine and live oak that stretch up into the hills.</p><p>At the north end of the pasture stands the scorched, decimated remains of a large manor home, its blackened dormers silhouetted against the sky like petrified skeletons, its windows blown out by a recent maelstrom. Over the last couple of months, fires have taken out large chunks of the suburbs and farmhouses south of Atlanta.</p><p>Back in August, after the first human encounters with walking corpses, the panic that swept across the South played havoc with the emergency infrastructure. Hospitals got overloaded and then closed down, firehouses went dark, and Interstate 85 clogged up with wrecks. People gave up finding stations on their battery-operated radios, and then started looking for supplies to scavenge, places to loot, alliances to strike, and areas in which to hunker.</p><p>The people gathered here on this abandoned homestead found each other on the dusty back roads weaving through the patchwork tobacco farms and deserted strip malls of Pike, Lamar, and Meriwether counties. Comprising all ages, including over a dozen families with small children, their convoy of sputtering, dying vehicles grew&nbsp;... until the need to find shelter and breathing room became paramount.</p><p>Now they sprawl across this two-square-acre parcel of vacant land like a throwback to some depression-era Hooverville, some of them living in their cars, others carving out niches on the softer grass, a few of them already ensconced in small pup tents around the periphery. They have very few firearms, and very little ammunition. Garden implements, sporting goods, kitchen equipment&#x2014;all the niceties of civilized life&#x2014;now serve as weapons. Dozens of these survivors are still pounding stakes into the cold, scabrous ground, working diligently, racing some unspoken, invisible clock, struggling to erect their jury-rigged sanctuaries&#x2014;each one of them oblivious to the peril that approaches through the pines to the north.</p><p>One of the settlers, a lanky man in his mid-thirties in a John Deere cap and leather jacket, stands under the edge of a gigantic field of canvas in the center of the pasture, his chiseled features shaded by the gargantuan tent fabric. He supervises a group of sullen teenagers gathered under the canvas. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, ladies, put your backs into it!&#x201d; he barks, hollering over the din of clanging metal filling the chilled air.</p><p>The teens grapple with a massive wooden beam, which serves as the center mast of what is essentially a large circus tent. They found the tent back on I-85, strewn in a ditch next to an overturned ...</p></p><h2>Freedom of the Mask</h2><p>The year is 1703, and Matthew Corbett, professional &#x201c;problem solver,&#x201d; is missing. Last seen by his friends in New York before he departed on a lucrative, seemingly straightforward mission for the Herrald Agency in Charles Town, he's been too long absent. His comrade-in-arms Hudson Greathouse has an increasing sense the young friend he thinks of as a son must have met with some unexpected peril. Following his hunch, Greathouse retraces Matthew's steps only to find him first presumed dead, then accused of murdering a young woman and apparently en route to London with a devious Prussian count last encountered on Professor Fell's Pendulum Island. <br><br>Little does he know that Matthews's circumstances are growing worse by the second. For when Matthew arrives in the bustling squalor of Londontown, he's come shackled, charged for the murder of Count Anton Mannerheim Dahlgren. No matter the lack of body, presumed lost to the ocean. He soon finds himself locked up in the infamous Newgate prison, and has drawn the interest of a mysterious mask-wearing vigilante accused of several gruesome murders. Greathouse and the woman Matthew loves, Berry Grigsby, travel across the high seas to England to aid their friend, but it is impossible to know whether they will reach him in time to save his life. <br><br><i>Freedom of the Mask</i> is the sixth installment in bestselling author Robert McCammon's acclaimed series of standalone historical thrillers featuring the exploits of a young hero the USA Character Approved Blog has called &#x201c;the Early American James Bond.&#x201d; The most surprising and ambitious volume to date, this is a novel filled with unpredictable twists and a note-perfect depiction of early 1700s London.

In <i>Hold Everything Dear</i>, he artistry and activism mesh in an attempt to make sense of the world as we have come to know it during the past six years.<br><br>Berger analyzes the nature of terrorism and the profound despair that gives rise to it. He writes about the homelessness of millions across the globe who have been forced by poverty and war into lives as refugees. He discusses Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Serbia, Bosnia, China, Indonesia--anyplace the power of corporations, the military, or paramilitary elements is being exercised, depriving ordinary citizens of autonomy or livelihoods or the most basic of freedoms.<br><br>Singularly lucid and bold, <i>Hold Everything Dear</i> fully acknowledges the depth of suffering occurring around the world and suggests ideas and action that might finally help bring it to an end. From one of the most widely admired, articulate, and impassioned writers of our time, this is a powerful collections of essays that holds a starkly reflective mirror up to post-9/11 realities.</p><p>John Berger is the author of many works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Shape of a Pocket, Here Is Where We Meet, </i>the <i>Into Their Labours </i>trilogy, <i>About Looking, Ways of Seeing, </i>and <i>G., </i>for which he won the Booker Prize. He lives in a small rural community in France.<i>Wanting Now</i> <br>(April 2006) <br><br>The world has changed. Information is being communicated differently. Misinformation is developing its techniques. On a world scale emigration has become the principal means of survival. The national state of those who had suffered the worst genocide in history has become, militarily speaking, fascist. National states in general have been politically downsized and reduced to the role of vassals serving the new world economic order. The visionary political vocabulary of three centuries has been garbaged. In short, the economic and military global tyranny of today has been established.<br><br>At the same time new methods of resistance to this tyranny are being discovered. Rebels now have to be not so much obedient as self-reliant. Within the growing opposition centralized authority has been replaced by spontaneous co-operation. Long-term programmes are replaced by urgent alliances over specific issues. Civil society is learning and beginning to practice the guerrilla tactics of political resistance.<br><br>Today the desire for justice is multitudinous. This is to say that struggles against injustice, struggles for survival, for self-respect, for human rights, should never be considered merely in terms of their immediate demands, their organizations, or their historical consequences. They cannot be reduced to &#x2018;movements&#x2019;. A movement describes a mass of people collectively moving towards a definite goal, which they either achieve or fail to achieve. Yet such a description ignores, or does not take into account, the countless personal choices, encounters, illuminations, sacrifices, new desires, griefs and, finally, memories, which the movement brought about, but which are, in the strict sense, incidental to that movement. <br><br>The promise of a movement is its future victory; whereas the promises of the incidental moments are instantaneous. Such moments include, life-enhancingly or tragically, experiences of freedom in action. (Freedom without actions does not exist.) Such moments&#x2014;as no historical &#x2018;outcome&#x2019; can ever be&#x2014;are transcendental, are what Spinoza termed eternal, and they are as multitudinous as the stars in an expanding universe. <br><br>Not all desires lead to freedom, but freedom is the experience of a desire being acknowledged, chosen and pursued. Desire never concerns the mere possession of something, but the changing of something. Desire is a wanting. A wanting now. Freedom does not constitute the fulfilment of that wanting, but the acknowledgement of its supremacy.<br>Today the infinite is beside the poor.</p><h2>Upstate: Records and Recollections of Northern New York</h2><p>Historical recollections of life in nirthern NY stater.</p><p></p><h2>Ramses II</h2><p>King Ramses II distinguished himself as a warrior, builder of magnificent monuments, and model for rulers to follow. Nothing will bring his life and times into sharper focus than this breathtaking volume, filled with oversize color photos--many rare--of the ancient temples, tombs, and statuary he had constructed. Among these awe-inspiring feats of art and engineering: the astonishing hall at Karnak in Thebes; his father's funerary temple on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor, as well as one for himself, called the Ramesseum; and the rock hewn temple of Abu Simbel. Close-ups showcase the incredible decorative detail carved onto the stonework, while maps and blueprints provide a detailed layout of all the structures.

Because of Sartre's failing eyesight, it was not possible for him either to read the critical essays or to respond in the usual way to his critics. Nor did he feel able to prepare an autobiography. Thus, in order to collect the material needed for the volume, it was necessary to conduct personal taped interviews with Sartre and then to have those interviews translated, edited, and arranged in an order that would approximate as closely as possible the customary format of the volumes in the Library of Living Philosophers series. <br><br>Skillfully and conscientiously conducted, the interviews themselves resulted in a unique and valuable document. At the time they occurred, Sartre was in good health except for his near-blindness, and he answered questions in a lively and easy manner. Although he seemed most comfortable when talking autobiographically, he nevertheless responded to many of the philosophical questions raised by the contributors to this volume.</p><p>This unique selection presents the essential elements of Sartre&#39;s lifework -- organized systematically and made available in one volume for the first time in any language.Philosopher, novelist, playwright, and polemicist, <b>Jean-Paul Sartre</b> is thought to have been the central figure in post-war European culture and political thinking. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Age of Reason</i>,<i> The Words</i>,&nbsp;and the play&nbsp;<i>No Exit&nbsp;</i>among other works.</p><h2>The Third Reich in History and Memory</h2><p><p>In this fascinating and enlightening collection of essays, one of the most important historians of our time reflects on the ways our understanding of Nazi Germany have been transformed in the twenty-first century.</p><p> Richard Evans examines new historical perspectives on the Third Reich, such as showing how it is increasingly viewed in a broader international - even global - context, as part of the age of imperialism. He investigates how Nazi policies in Europe drew on Hitler's image of the American colonisation of the Great Plains, how companies like Volkswagen and Krupp operated on a global scale and - perhaps most controversial of all - how historians have come to see the Holocaust not as a unique historical event but as a genocide with parallels and similarities in other countries and at other times. THE THIRD REICH IN HISTORY AND MEMORY explores how these new perspectives have brought dividends, but also offers a critical perspective on the ways they are changing our perception of the period. </p><p> THE THIRD REICH IN HISTORY AND MEMORY, in Richard Evans' characteristically compelling style, shows us that memory has to be subjected to the close scrutiny of history if it is to stand up to examination, while history's implications for collective cultural memories of Nazism must be spelled out with precision as well as with passion.</p></p><p><br><strong>Richard J. Evans</strong> is Regius Professor of History at Cambridge University. Knighted in 2012 for his services to scholarship, he is the author of many prizewinning and bestselling books, including his acclaimed study of the Third Reich, whose three volumes have been translated into twelve languages.<br><br>"[Evans is] one of the English-speaking world's foremost historians of modern Germany...in these essays, as in so much of his scholarship, he is right on the mark." --<em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Evans' careful discussion serves as a reminder of the naivet� of thinking that dictators have no popular support in the countries they control, or that removing them is easy. But he also shows how unfair it is to assume that everyone (or even the majority of people) in a dictatorship is responsible for the regimes' actions. Collective guilt and collective innocence are appealing myths, but the realities of power are much messier." --<em>The Pacific Standard</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Mr. Evans may now be a rather grand pillar of the historical establishment - a former Regius Professor of History at Cambridge University, 'Sir Richard' since he was knighted for services to scholarship in 2012 - but he shows no signs of settling into comfortable eminence. He thinks hard about what history is and how it is done...

In a preface, Sis makes refer ence to Columbus escaping the walls of fear and ignorance that encompassed 15th-century Europe and uses that mo tif freely throughout--as a curtain framing a view of Genoa, a background for pictures of Columbus's early life, and in an endpaper map of Europe sur rounded by a wall.

Sis uses col ors ranging from drab browns and grays, to a rose-colored sky that is a background for the king and queen of Spain, and deep blues and greens for the ocean.

There was her picture, all bright eyes and perky smile. And there were her dreams and desires, summed up in twenty-five words or less.</p> <p>HARDWORKING IDEALIST SEEKS WORLD PEACE, JUSTICE, AND AN INTERESTING MAN FOR FUN AND ADVENTURE. NO WHINERS, TORMENTED ARTISTS, OR DEADBEAT MUSICIANS NEED APPLY.</p> <p>When she was living in Denver, the ad had generated a few dates with aging hipsters who thought "fun" and "adventure" were code words for kinky sex. None of them were interesting, and all of them were whiners when they found out that her idea of fun was roller coasters and rock climbing.</p> <p>Moving the cursor down to the bottom of the page, she hit the Delete Profile button and a box popped up, blinking frantically.</p> <p>Are you sure you want to give up on love?</p> <p>Yup, she was sure.</p> <p>She hit the kill button then gazed out the small slice of window she could see from her office at Phoenix House, an old Victorian home that had been repurposed as a group home for foster children. There was a hardware store straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting across the street, with a tattered awning and a bench on which old men chewed over the news every morning. A rusty pickup, mostly blue with a red tailgate, was parked askew with one wheel up on the curb. There were no window-shoppers cruising the sidewalks, no traffic backed up at the single streetlight, no taxicabs, no street vendors. And she sincerely doubted there were any interesting men.</p> <p>Actually, there were interesting men in Wynott. The trouble was, most of them were over seventy-five and none of them seemed to grasp the concept of a group home. Half of them were convinced she was running a juvenile hall for delinquents, and the other half thought she was a single mom with five kids. Since Isaiah was African-American, Carter as blond as Brad Pitt, and Frankie a dark-eyed Italian, they probably figured the kids had at least three fathers. It was all a bit of a shock for a small Wyoming town.</p> <p>That was probably why her call for volunteers had gone unanswered until today, when her boss had called to let her know he'd talked a friend of his into volunteering as a sports coach. The guy should be arriving any minute. In fact, he was late. Hopefully, he'd...</p> <p>Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!</p> <p>There might not be any men in Wynott to make her heart flutter, but the sound of the old home's doorbell never failed to make it leap in her chest. Jacob Prescott Wynn, the founder of Wynott, had built Phoenix House with every deluxe feature the Victorian era had to offer, including delicate gingerbread eaves, hand-carved wood paneling, and faceted glass doorknobs. He'd also installed a pullout doorbell that made a sound like the "you lose" buzzer on a game show. It was so loud, it scared the bejesus out of half the neighborhood every time Sierra had company. This was very helpful to the women in town, who kept the gossip grapevine growing and found Sierra's comings and goings to be fine fertilizer.</p> <p>She headed for the front door, wondering what kind of sports coach Mike Malloy had come up with. The owner of Phoenix House and the son of a senator, Mike was an overgrown frat boy. His friends reminded Sierra of a bunch of overweight Labrador retrievers, falling all over the place with their tongues hanging out. They were rude but good-natured, handsome but a little soft in the gut.</p> <p>Swinging the heavy wood door open, she gaped at her guest. Surely, surely this wasn't any friend of Mike's.</p> <p>There wasn't an ounce of frat boy in this guy. Not an ounce of fat, either. Just to make sure, Sierra let her gaze drift downward from the brim of his battered felt hat to his broad shoulders and muscular chest, which were both hidden-unfortunately-by a plaid Western-style shirt. He was wearing some kind of fancy belt buckle too, with a picture of a horse on it. Squinting, she tried to read the lettering around the edges but found herself distracted by the very obvious bulge beneath it. The jeans fit just fine everywhere else but seemed a bit strained here.</p> <p>The hat. The hat. Look at the hat. And stop staring at his-his whatsit.</p> <p>She'd once heard a country song about how you could gauge the quality of a cowboy by the condition of his hat. Barstool cowboys had shiny new hats, but real cowboys had hats that had been through everything from snowstorms to stampedes.</p> <p>This guy was apparently the real thing, and the battered brim shaded the hard gray eyes of an outlaw. His jaw was darkened by stubble that made him look like he'd just come off the Chisholm Trail with Kevin Costner and Tom Selleck, though she suspected he could outride and out-rope both of them.</p> <p>"I'm supposed to talk to the manager," he said.</p> <p>He didn't sound like Kevin Costner or Tom Selleck. He sounded like Sam Elliott, all gravelly and masculine. His voice curled into Sierra's ear and slid down her backbone, coiling up somewhere warm and making it even warmer.</p> <p>"The manager?" he repeated.</p> <p>Sierra sighed. At five foot next-to-nothing, with short, blond hair and dimples that popped into being if she even thought about smiling, she was rarely taken for authority. Certainly no one ever guessed she'd been a Denver cop for three years. She'd gone into law enforcement figuring she'd be helping people, but instead she'd found herself escorting the same petty criminals in and out of the revolving doors of the justice system-crime to prison to parole to crime. She wasn't sure who she was really helping.</p> <p>Then, a child abuse case inspired her to go back to school, majoring in social work and child psychology. When she'd returned to Denver as a social worker, she'd worked some hard cases in dangerous neighborhoods. It had been her oversized tough-girl attitude, born from a childhood on those same streets, that kept her safe.</p> <p>It was her tough-girl attitude that got her the job at Phoenix House too. These kids needed special protection, and her combination of a social work degree and law enforcement experience had made her the perfect applicant.</p> <p>So where was that tough-girl attitude now?</p> <p>Evidently it had taken a break to curl up in her belly with Sam Elliott's voice.</p> <p>"I'm Sierra Dunn, group mom here at Phoenix House." She started to extend a hand, but he kept his fists jammed deep in his pockets.</p> <p>No handshake? No problem. His paws were probably dirty anyway.</p> <p>He stepped inside, glancing around the newly renovated house as if he was looking for decorating ideas, but he wouldn't find any at Phoenix House. The old place's renovation had apparently busted the state's budget, so the furniture consisted of refugees from various government offices-gray metal desks, dented file cabinets, and chrome chairs with ugly vinyl cushions.</p> <p>"Name's Ridge Cooper. I'm from Decker Ranch, out west of town."</p> <p>"Oh. I've heard of you," she blurted.</p> <p>You couldn't spend five minutes in Wynott without hearing about Ridge Cooper and his brothers. The three cowboys and their rodeo exploits seemed to be the single source of pride for a town that had fallen on hard times. The men in town spoke of the brothers with envy, the women with admiration.</p> <p>Sierra didn't get it. Riding wild horses didn't make this guy any better than Ed Boone, who ran a thriving hardware store despite the town's economic struggles, or Colt Carson, who had turned the hole-in-the-wall Red Dawg Bar into a cross between a senior center, a soup kitchen, and a Wild West saloon. Tying up baby cows for a living didn't make him better than Phoebe Niles, who was raising an energetic granddaughter on the slim profits from a gas station at the edge of town. Ed and Colt and Phoebe were the people who kept Wynott alive. Not the Decker brothers.</p> <p>"I'm looking to volunteer." He glanced down the hall, where the boys were cheering and razzing each other over a video game. The old house's high ceilings and cavernous spaces amplified everything.</p> <p>"How many you got?" he asked.</p> <p>"Only five right now. We're set up for more, but that's it so far."</p> <p>He nodded. "No problem. I'm used to dealing with a herd. You just have to anticipate what they're going to do. Jink left when they zig, right when they zag."</p> <p>He gestured as he spoke, like his left hand was a cow and his right a mounted cowboy. The left hand didn't stand a chance; it was headed off in a heartbeat.</p> <p>"These are kids, not cows," she said.</p> <p>"Cattle."</p> <p>"Kids."</p> <p>Sierra felt like she was arguing with the boys. You could go back and forth for an hour and never resolve anything.</p> <p>"No, I meant that's what you call them. Cattle, not cows," he said.</p> <p>"All right. Cattle." She narrowed her eyes. "What are you going to teach them, anyway?"</p> <p>He shrugged. "Riding. Roping. Rodeo."</p> <p>She should have known. He wasn't exactly dressed for soccer.</p> <p>Leading him across the hall to the old walk-in pantry she'd claimed as an office, she edged past her rickety fiberboard bookcase to her scratch-and-dent desk. The cowboy dropped into the old captain's chair across from her, but rather than crossing his legs like a normal human, he tilted the chair back on two legs and draped one booted leg over the arm. Maybe sitting in chairs wasn't enough of a challenge when your day job was sticking to the saddles of bucking horses.</p> <p>And that day job was a problem. She needed someone who could make a commitment. From what she'd heard, rodeo cowboys were always on the move.</p> <p>"You travel around a lot, don't you?" She kept her smile friendly, but her eyes watched for signs of weakness. Volunteers for this kind of work always arrived all bright-eyed and hopeful, ready to save the world one kid at a time. But her boys were slow to trust-with good reason-and most folks gave up when they didn't get the warm fuzzies they were expecting. Gave up and walked away, just like the boys' families had.</p> <p>"You'll do more harm than good if you take off on these kids once we've started."</p> <p>He'd taken off his hat upon entering the house, so she got the full force of those eyes. Darkness cut through the gray, reminding her of broken crystal, and his gaze was direct.</p> <p>"I'll be here," he said. "Trust me."</p> <p>She decided she might as well take his word for it. Not because she'd deluded herself into thinking he was some paragon of cowboy virtue, but because he was so abrupt she figured he wouldn't bother to lie to her.</p> <p>But she couldn't figure out why he wanted to do this. He didn't seem like your typical do-gooder dad or concerned citizen. In fact, he seemed almost reluctant. She needed to probe deeper.</p> <p>"Do you have any experience with children?" she asked.</p> <p>"I was one once," the cowboy said.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>The question slipped out in a tone of disbelief.</p> <p>"Okay, I don't know much about kids," he admitted. "But Mike thought it was a good idea to teach your boys to ride, maybe rope a little." He flushed. "Well, not your boys. I know you're not..."</p> <p>"That's actually how I think of them." Sierra smiled. "They're my boys as long as I'm here. And I'm hoping everyone else will see it that way too. If people can see us as just another family, the boys can really feel like they belong here."</p> <p>His eyes narrowed. "In Wynott?"</p> <p>"Well, sure. Why not?"</p> <p>He didn't laugh. She didn't blame him. Everyone here had probably heard the joke about a million times. Old Jacob Wynn had had a playful sense of humor, but after a hundred years, it was probably getting a little stale.</p> <p>"This is the last-chance placement for these kids," she said. "They've been rejected, over and over, from one foster home after another. They run away. They play hooky. They steal. They fight. And they don't think much of authority."</p> <p>The cowboy smiled for the first time. "Sounds like we'll get along great."</p> <p>"I hope so," Sierra said. Ridge Cooper seemed like an unlikely ally, but he had influence in this tiny town, and she'd take any help she could get. "It's not the kids' fault. Authority's never done a thing to earn their trust, and the rules have never worked for them, either. The foster care system in this state is terrible. Not just in this state. In this country." She realized she was ranting and reined herself in, settling back in her chair and smiling. "I think Wynott can help fix it."</p> <p>He snorted. "How do you figure that? This town's about ready to tumble down and go back to the land, dust to dust. The folks who still live here are either too poor to leave or too tired to try."</p> <p>She started enumerating the town's charms on her fingers. "Small-town setting. Isolation. Elderly population. I'll bet a lot of these old folks spend all their time watching what goes on and gossiping. Am I right?"</p> <p>He nodded with a wry smile, just as she expected.</p> <p>"It's small, it's safe, and there are plenty of folks to watch over the kids," she continued. "I'm hoping Wynott can become a real hometown for them. I've always thought that might be the way to go with foster kids." She ignored his disbelieving stare. "Maybe if we give them roots, they'll stop running."</p></p><h2>How Sweet the Sound</h2><p>This is about the amazing stories and grace-filled reflection on beloved hymns and gospel songs.

This book will take you through your past, your potentials, your life. First, with a series of self-examinations and using a special version of the Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation, you plot yourself on the Tone Scale. Then, applying a series of light, yet powerful processes, you embark on the great adventure of self-discovery. This book further contains embracive principles that reach any case, from the lowest to the highest&#x2014;including auditing techniques so effective, they are referred to by L. Ron Hubbard again and again, through all following years of research into the highest states. In sum, this book not only moves one up the Tone Scale, but can pull a person out of almost anything. Included are:</p><ul> <li>The laws of survival and abundance</li> <li>The most embracive description of consciousness</li> <li>Our efforts for immortality and its relationship to matter, energy, space and time</li> <li>Essays describing a broad array of discoveries including time, remembering, forgetting, imagination, valences and special auditing lists for each</li> <li>And, beyond all those revelations, self-processing lists that provide the most powerful of auditing and which can be done anywhere and at any time&#x2014;uncovering the real world of you</li></ul><p>The barriers of life are really just shadows.

Ron Hubbard</p><p>There are only two tests of a life well lived L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard once remarked: Did one do as one intended? And were people glad one lived? In testament to the first stands the full body of his life&#x2019;s work, including some 12,000 writings and 3,000 tape-recorded lectures of Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; &nbsp;In evidence of the second are the hundreds of millions of individuals whose lives have been demonstrably bettered because he lived. They are the more than 28 million students now reading superlatively owing to L. Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s educational discoveries; they are the millions of men and women freed from substance abuse through L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s breakthroughs in drug rehabilitation; they are the near 100 million who have been touched by his nonreligious moral code: and they are the many millions more who hold his work to be the spiritual cornerstone of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Although best known for Dianetics and Scientology, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard cannot be so simply categorized. If nothing else, his life was too varied, his influence too broad. There are tribesmen in Southern Africa, for example, who know nothing of Dianetics and Scientology, but they know L. Ron Hubbard the educator.&nbsp; Likewise, there are factory workers in Albania who know him only for his administrative discoveries; children in China who know him only as the author of their moral code, and readers in dozens of languages who know him only for his novels. So, no, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is not an easy man to categorize and certainly does not fit popular misconceptions of &#x201c;religious founder&#x201d; as an aloof and contemplative figure. Yet the more one comes to know this man and his achievements, the more one comes to realize he was precisely the sort of person to have brought us Scientology, the only major religion to have been founded in the twentieth century.&nbsp;</p><p>What Scientology offers is likewise what one would expect of a man such as&nbsp; L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard. For not only does it provide a fully unique approach to our most fundamental questions&#x2014;Who are we? From where did we come and what is our destiny? But it further provides an equally unique technology for greater spiritual awareness. So how would we expect to characterize the founder of such a religion? Clearly, he would have to be larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields&#x2014;all exactly L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is, if Mr. Hubbard had stopped after only one of his many accomplishments he would still be celebrated today. For example, with 46 million works of fiction in circulation, including such monumental bestsellers as Battlefield Earth, Fear and the Mission Earth series, Mr. Hubbard is unquestionably one of the most acclaimed and widely read authors of all time. His novels have earned some of the world&#x2019;s most prestigious literary awards, and he has very genuinely been described as &#x201c;one of the most prolific and influential writers of the twentieth century.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>His earlier accomplishments are similarly impressive. As a barnstorming aviator through the 1930s he was known as &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; and broke local records for sustained glider flight. As a leader of expeditions, he is credited with conducting the first complete Puerto Rican mineralogical survey under United States protectorship and his navigational annotations still influence the maritime guides for British Columbia. His experimentation with early radio direction finding further became the basis for the Long Range Navigational system (Loran). And, as a lifelong photographer, his works have been displayed in galleries on two continents, with the definitive body of his photographs in traveling and permanent exhibits still drawing tens of thousands every year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among other avenues of research, Mr. Hubbard developed and codified an administrative technology that is utilized by more than 200,000 organizations worldwide, including multinational corporations, charitable bodies, political parties, schools, youth clubs and every imaginable small business. Likewise Mr. Hubbard&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed educational methods are utilized by more than a hundred thousand educators, while his equally acclaimed drug rehabilitation program has proven at least five times more effective than similarly aimed programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, however impressive these figures, no measure of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is complete without some appreciation of what became his life&#x2019;s work: Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; The world&#x2019;s most effective force for positive change, the Church of Scientology represents spiritual freedom for millions of people the world over. They come from every walk of life, every culture and every strata of society. Moreover, when one is speaking of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s discoveries relating to the human mind and spirit, one is ultimately speaking of the philosophic foundation of all he accomplished: better education, crime-free cities, drug-free campuses, stable and ethical organizations and cultural revitalization through the arts&#x2014;all this and more is made possible because of the breakthroughs in Dianetics and Scientology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Summons</h2><p>After kidnapping the daughter of the police chief in Bath, England, an escaped convict demands a meeting with the officer who originally arrested him, drawing ex-cop Peter Diamond back into the fray.

The day, I swear to God, has to be at least ninety-five degrees. Christchurch heat. Schizophrenic weather. Sweat is dripping from my body. My fingers are wet-rubber damp. I lean forward and twist the keys in the ignition, grab my briefcase, and climb out of the car. Out here, the air-conditioning actually works. I reach the front door and fumble with the lock. I breathe a sigh of relief when I step inside.<br> <br>I stroll through to the kitchen. Angela, I can hear, is in the shower upstairs. I&#x2019;ll disturb her later. For now, I need a drink. I walk to the fridge. It has a stainless-steel door in which my reflection looks like a ghost. I open the door and squat down in front of it for close to a minute, making friends with the cool air. The fridge offers me both beer and Coke. I take a beer, twist off the cap, and sit down at the table. I&#x2019;m no heavy drinker, but I knock this bottle back in maybe twenty seconds. The fridge offers up another bottle. Who am I to say no? I lean back in the chair. Put my feet up on the table. Consider taking off my shoes. You know that feeling? A hot day at work. Stress for eight hours. Then sitting down, feet in the air, beer in hand, and you take your shoes off.<br> <br>Pure bliss.<br> <br>Listening to the shower upstairs, I casually sip at my second beer of the year. Takes me five minutes to finish this one, and now I&#x2019;m hungry. Back at the fridge and to the slice of cold pizza I spied on my first trip. I shrug. Why not? It isn&#x2019;t as though I need to watch my weight.<br> <br>I sit back at the table. Feet in the air. The same thing works for pizza as it does for beer once you get those shoes off. Right now, though, I don&#x2019;t have the time. I wolf down the pizza, pick up my briefcase, and make my way upstairs. The stereo in the bedroom is pumping out a song I recognize, but can&#x2019;t name. Same goes for the artist. Nevertheless, I find myself humming along as I lay my briefcase on the bed, knowing the tune will be stuck in my mind for hours. I sit down next to the briefcase. Open it. Take the newspaper out. The first page offers up the sort of news that makes newspapers sell. Often I wonder if the media makes half this stuff up, just to inflate sales. There&#x2019;s definitely a market for it.<br> <br>I hear the shower turn off but ignore it, preferring to read the paper. It&#x2019;s an article about some guy who&#x2019;s been terrorizing the city. Killing women. Torture. Rape. Homicide. The stuff movies are made of. A couple of minutes go by and I&#x2019;m still sitting here reading when Angela, wiping her hair with a towel, steps out of the bathroom surrounded by white steam and the smell of skin lotion.<br> <br>I lower the newspaper and smile.<br> <br>She looks over at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who the fuck are you?&#x201d; she asks.</p><h2>Bringing Home the Birkin: My Life in Hot Pursuit of the World&#39;s Most Coveted Handbag</h2><p><blockquote><p>An insider's hilarious, whirlwind account of his years spent globe-trotting in search of the holy grail of handbags: the Birkin</p></blockquote><p>For more than twenty years, the Herm�s Birkin bag has been the iconic symbol of fashion, luxury, and wealth. Though the bag is often seen dangling from the arms of celebrities, there is a fabled waiting list of more than two years to buy one from Herm�s, and the average fashionista has a better chance of climbing Mount Everest in Prada pumps than of possessing one of these coveted carryalls. Unless, of course, she happens to know Michael Tonello . . .</p><p>Michael's newfound career started with an impulsive move to Barcelona, a vanished job assignment, no work visa, and an Herm�s scarf sold on eBay to generate some quick cash. But soon the resourceful Michael discovered the truth about the waiting list and figured out the secret to getting Herm�s to part with one of these precious bags. Millions of dollars worth of Birkins later, Michael had become one of eBay's most successful entrepreneurs&#x2014;and a Robin Hood to thousands of desperate rich women.</p><p>With down-to-earth wit, Michael chronicles the unusual ventures that took him to nearly every continent, from eBay to Paris auction house and into the lives of celebrities and poseurs. Flirting with danger, Michael recounts the heady rush of hand delivering his first big score to famed songwriter Carole Bayer Sager in Paris; how he had to hire thugs to rescue a bag that one of his "shoppers" held for ransom; and the story of the Oscar-worthy performances that allowed him to snag "reserved" bags from other, less dogged Birkin seekers. </p><p>Whether he's relating his wining and dining, buying and selling, dodging and weaving, laughing and crying, or schmoozing and stammering, Michael is a master raconteur who weaves together tales of hunting Birkins in the world's most posh locales, memories of meals that would make any gastronome salivate, anecdotes of obsessed collectors with insatiable desires, and sweetly intimate stories about his family, friends, and finding true love. The result is a memoir that is distinctive, fun, page-turning, and as addictive as its namesake. </p></p><p><p>Originally from Massachusetts, Michael Tonello traveled the world as a makeup artist and hairdresser before resettling in Spain to become an eBay luxury reseller of all things Herm�s.

The covers tell as much about rock history as the commentary from the expected cast of RS scribes and hangers-on. Very early covers were in black-and-white, wrapping a newsprint tabloid featuring articles and reviews redolent of smug, anticommercial hipness. Over time, the attitude eroded, and color covers featured fewer scruffy rockers and more magnificently quaffed celebrities du jour. In short, the covers reflect the drift of RS's focus from music to film, TV, politics, . . . whatever. And still, the "book" is mostly rock 'n' roll. Where else can one see Janet Jackson and Jennifer Anniston naked and Bill Clinton and Woody Allen clothed (good editorial decisions, those), always very well photographed? Buy this for the flash and the history, and ignore anything Pete Townshend or Jann Wenner has to say in it. Aging baby boomers will probably like it most, but it should appeal to pop fans of all ages. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>The Oxford Book of Essays</h2><p>When Montaigne developed the essay in the sixteenth century, he could not have imagined the power and longevity of his creation. "He did not set up for a philosopher, wit, orator, or moralist," wrote Hazlitt, "but he became all these by merely daring to tell us whatever passed through his mind." Ever since, writers have seized upon his example, and for over four hundred years we have encountered astonishing insights and breathtaking language by following what has passed through their minds, as recounted in the essay. And now some of the finest essays of all time have been gathered together by John Gross, former editor of <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, in an outstanding new anthology.<br> Ranging from the early 1600s through the 1980s, this sweeping collection includes 140 essays by 120 of the finest writers in the history of the English language. John Gross has collected classics and rare gems, representative samples and personal favorites, intimate essays and learned, serious reflections and hysterically funny satire, by both British and American writers. Here is Eveleyn Waugh, providing tips on how to move in Well-Informed Circles ("Attribute all facts of common knowledge to personal information; for instance, do not say, 'What a wet week it has been,' but, 'They tell me at Greenwich they have registered the highest rainfall for six weeks'"); Ralph Waldo Emerson on conservatism and innovation; Ambrose Bierce on "the horror of the characteristic American custom of promiscuous, unsought, and unauthorized introductions"; Oscar Wilde on the critic as artist ("It is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiased opion, which is no doubt the reason why an unbiased opinion is always absolutely valueless"); Rose Macaulay on dinner parties; and James Baldwin, musing about what a remote Swiss village tells him about race in the wider world ("Joyce is right about history being a nightmare--but it may be the nightmare from which no one <em>can</em> awaken. People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in them.").<br> The authors Gross has gathered form a gallery of genius, all indispensable masters of rhetoric, from Samuel Butler to Samuel Johnson, from John Dryden to Ben Franklin, from Geoge Eliot to George Bernard Shaw, from E.B. White to Joan Didion. Including book reviews and travel sketches, history lessons and meditations, reflections on art and on potato chips, these essays sample four centuries of eloquence and insight in a collection that is at once immensely enlightening, edifying, and entertaining.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>John Gross</strong> is the author of <em>The Rise and Fall of the Man of Letters</em> and editor of <em>The Oxford Book of Aphorisms</em>.

A sensation when published in Moscow and a bestseller in Europe, the memoirs of Anna Larina-the widow of the legendary Bolshevik leader Nikolai Bukharin condemned by Stalin at the infamous Moscow Trial of 1938-open a new window into the drama and secrets of Soviet history. This remarkable woman tells the story of not only of her twenty years in Gulag prison camps and exile, and that of her infant son from whom she separated for so long, but also of her special life as a daughter and wife among the founding fathers of the Soviet Union.Stephen F.

She turned to one side then the other looking at the slinky black dress that hugged her curves.<br>&#x201c;Definitely need to work out more,&#x201d; she mumbled as she frowned at her reflection and sucked in her stomach.<br>Her door pushed open and Whitney, one of her flatmates, poked her dark head through the door. &#x201c;Wow, Dani. You look amazing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure you won&#x2019;t come with me?&#x201d; Danielle asked for the tenth time. They had all planned to spend New Year&#x2019;s together with another group of friends two months ago, but now Dani would end up alone with Mitchell. It wasn&#x2019;t that Mitchell was a bad sort, just someone who didn&#x2019;t get the hint that she didn&#x2019;t want to date him.<br>Whitney laughed and shook her head. &#x201c;Not on your life. Joe says he has something he wants to talk to me about. I&#x2019;m hoping he&#x2019;s finally going to ask me to marry him. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for months!&#x201d;<br>Danielle smiled and hugged Whitney. She was happy for her friend, but it was just another reminder she was alone. Again.<br>&#x201c;I want you to call me as soon as he proposes. Well, after you say yes, of course,&#x201d; Danielle said with a laugh.<br>&#x201c;I will. I promise. Listen, I came to ask if I could borrow your black heels. The new ones you bought this week?&#x201d;<br>Danielle hurried to her closet and opened the Kate Spade box. &#x201c;Yes, you need to look your best. You know Clair&#x2019;s pearls would look great with your dress.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already asked to borrow them,&#x201d; Whitney said as she took the shoes. &#x201c;I have the most wonderful friends in the world.&#x201d;<br>Danielle grinned as she leaned her hand on the doorknob. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just thankful we all wear about the same size. It&#x2019;s saved me a lot of money over the years.&#x201d;<br>As Whitney walked to her room, Danielle closed the door and her smile faded. So much for a rowdy group of friends to party with. Not that Danielle was a party girl. She was the opposite actually. It had been all of them who had talked her into going out on New Year&#x2019;s. And wouldn&#x2019;t you know everyone else would have something planned with their boyfriends?<br>Danielle sighed and looked at the clock on her nightstand. It was just after five o&#x2019;clock. She had enough time to run some errands before she met up with Mitchell and they headed to Blink&#x2019;s. Blink was the newest, hippest nightclub in Inverness, and they were putting on one hell of a party tonight.<br>After one more look in the mirror, Danielle reached for the bangle bracelets on her bureau and left her room. She liked the clink of the silver bracelets as she slid her arms into her coat.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving,&#x201d; Danielle called out.<br>&#x201c;Be careful!&#x201d; Whitney shouted through her door. &#x201c;A snowstorm has been forecast for tonight!&#x201d;<br>Danielle inwardly groaned while wrapping her scarf around her neck before she tugged on her gloves. &#x201c;Just what I need.&#x201d;<br>She grabbed her purse and keys and left the flat. A blast of cold wind hit her as she pulled the door closed and hurried down the stairs to her car waiting at the curb.<br>The car, a mid-1970s Mini, had been her aunt Josie&#x2019;s. When Josie had gotten too sick to drive it, she&#x2019;d given it to Danielle. Danielle loved the car, even if it had gotten more unreliable than not.<br>She unlocked her door and slid into the driver&#x2019;s seat. As usual, the car didn&#x2019;t start on the first try.<br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Danielle whispered as she turned the key once more.<br>There was a flare of life, and then nothing.<br>Danielle rubbed the car&#x2019;s dashboard slowly. &#x201c;I know you can do this,&#x201d; she told the car. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me down tonight.&#x201d;<br>On the third try, the Mini roared to life.<br>Danielle sat back with a smile on her face and fastened her seat belt. She pushed in the clutch and put the car in first before pulling out into the road.<br>She drove slowly through the icy, snow-covered streets as the sun sank below the horizon. Danielle would have preferred to get her errands done earlier, but she&#x2019;d had to stay later at her job than usual.<br>Wouldn&#x2019;t you know the boss-from-Hell had wanted to clear her desk so <i>she</i> could take the next week off? Danielle was supposed to have left the office at noon, but Isabella had other ideas.<br>Danielle mentally checked off the places in her mind as she ran errand after errand. Finally, she pulled up to the cemetery and turned off the car. She reached for the single pink rose on the passenger seat and got out of the car.<br>The snow that had fallen overnight was deep as Danielle meandered her way to the back of the cemetery and the Buchanan plot.<br>Though her parents were buried in America, there was a plaque with their names and the date they had been taken from her. Danielle wiped the snow from the plaque. She stared at their names and wondered how different her life would have been had they not gone out that fateful night.<br>It was a thought that haunted Danielle every year. Though the images of her parents had begun to fade in her mind, the memories she had of them would never leave her.<br>After a moment, she moved to her left and wiped the ice and snow from the large stone cross.<br>Josie had died on New Year&#x2019;s Eve five years earlier and Danielle came to her gravesite every year. No one was sure what had caused Josie&#x2019;s death. Each year she had grown weaker and weaker until her soul had left her body.<br>It had been painful to watch, but Danielle never left her side. They had spent countless hours together in the little time they had left. Josie had been the one Danielle had gone to with a problem, the one Danielle had gone to for answers.<br>And Josie had never let her down.<br>Josie had been the one who hadn&#x2019;t pushed her to talk, hadn&#x2019;t begged her to get on with her life. Josie simply let Danielle cope with the death of her parents as she needed.<br>She had warned Danielle that her time was about to end, but Danielle hadn&#x2019;t wanted to believe her. Until Josie&#x2019;s hand had gone slack in Danielle&#x2019;s grip.<br>&#x201c;I miss you, Aunt Josie,&#x201d; Danielle said, and placed the pink rose at the base of the cross.<br>Josie had been true to her word when Danielle had first met her. She had shown Danielle the wondrous world of magic.<br>It had been glorious. The first time she felt her magic move within her, it had changed her life.<br>Until they learned just what her magic did.<br>Danielle bit her lip as she recalled the pain that would bend her in two when she would find an object and not want to return it to its owner.<br>Of all the magical ability Danielle could have received, she hated hers. She had no choice when it came to using her magic. It forced her to bring the object&#x2014;whatever it might be&#x2014;to its rightful owner or suffer unimaginable pain.<br>Danielle realized that she had been squatting next to the cross for some time and her legs had grown numb from the cold. A large, fat snowflake landed on the back of her gloved hand.<br>&#x201c;You always did love the snow, Aunt Josie,&#x201d; Danielle mumbled. She kissed her fingers, then placed them on the cross. &#x201c;Until next year.&#x201d;<br>Danielle rose and walked back to her car. The streetlights had already blinked on as the darkness grew. She shoved her hands in her pockets and did her best not to slip on the ice.<br>The icy wind managed to find a way up her skirt and take whatever warmth she might have had from her. Danielle shuddered and hurriedly got into her car.<br>To her surprise, the Mini started on the first try. Danielle waited for other cars to pass, then pulled in behind them. She was supposed to meet Mitchell at his flat so they could go to dinner.<br>If she didn&#x2019;t know her flatmates so well, she&#x2019;d think they had set this up so she&#x2019;d be left alone with Mitchell. It wasn&#x2019;t that Mitch wasn&#x2019;t a nice guy. He was.<br>He just wasn&#x2019;t a guy she was interested in.<br>Which didn&#x2019;t make sense. He was good-looking, had a great job, and she had gotten to know him well over the last year.<br>But there was no connection between them. No spark, no chemistry.<br>It would be so much easier if there were, because Danielle knew Mitch liked her a lot. She could have the husband she&#x2019;d always wanted. She could have the family and kids&#x2014;everything.<br>However, her parents had told her to never compromise, and Danielle never had. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to start now.<br>Just as Danielle expected, there were no places to park close to Mitchell&#x2019;s flat. She ended up parking down the street and walking to his place.<br>She now wished she had suggested meeting him at the restaurant instead of letting him drive her. That sounded too much like a date, and this was anything but a date.<br>Danielle walked up the steps to his door and knocked. Almost instantly it opened. Mitchell, his dark hair combed back away from his face, smiled, the corners of his blue eyes crinkling.<br>&#x201c;I was getting worried,&#x201d; he said as he motioned for her to enter.<br>Danielle gratefully stepped in out of the cold. &#x201c;I had to run some errands.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I made reservations for dinner.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t move farther inside when he put his hand on the small of her back. &#x201c;Reservations? I thought we were eating at the pub as we agreed earlier.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mitchell said as he ran a hand over his hair in a nervous gesture. &#x201c;With it just being us two, I thought we could have a more&nbsp;... intimate dinner.&#x201d;<br>It was just what Danielle <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> want. She glanced at the floor, hating that she had to begin the evening like this. &#x201c;Mitchell&nbsp;... I like you. A lot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And I like you, Danielle.&#x201d;...</p><h2>Jubal&#39;s Wish</h2><p>After planning a picnic for his friends who are all too busy, grumpy, or depressed to attend, Jubal Bullfrog wishes for happiness for his animal friends and finds that sometimes wishes come true in unexpected ways.</p><p>Don and Audrey Wood have been an award-winning team for over 25 years. &#x201c;When our son, Bruce, was<br>very young, the best part of the day for my wife, Audrey, and me was reading him his bedtime picture<br>books....That's when I fell in love with children's literature and decided to illustrate, and occasionally<br>write, children's books,&#x201d; says Don, who grew up on his family's farm in California.

However, Gerdy is too busy with her seven scalawag toadlets and "old salt" Dalbert feels too sorry for himself, so Jubal continues alone. When he wishes his friends could be happy, a wizard appears to grant his request but warns him that, when you make wishes, "You never know how they'll turn out in the end." Returning home, he is disappointed to discover that nothing has changed for Gerdy or Dalbert but a storm is brewing on the horizon. The ensuing flood washes Jubal out to sea where he is rescued by Dalbert, who has enlisted Gerdy and her toadlets to serve as crew on his trusty old boat. All agree to embark on a grand adventure and they sail off under a rainbow together. Wish fulfillment at its most basic, this tale moves along briskly with a simple story line and predictable dialogue. The narrative is overwhelmed, though, by the oversized computer-assisted illustrations; blue skies and bluer water fill each double-page spread and the very realistic amphibians and reptiles are dramatically, if statically, posed. Jubal is appealing enough, particularly when he cries huge, ploppy computer-generated tears, but his total disregard for the rising floodwaters strains credulity as does his serendipitous rescue. While perfectly designed for group sharing, young listeners might make a wish of their own for a more engrossing adventure.<br><i>Carol Ann Wilson, Westfield Memorial Library, NJ </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wizard of Oz, 100th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>This special 100th-anniversary edition of L. Frank Baum's classic features eye-catching embossed gold foil on a centennial medallion as well as on the title. Santore's <i>Wizard of Oz</i> is widely acknowledged as the quintessential illustrated version of the tale for the picture book audience. His lush, full-color illustrations grace every page of the faithfully condensed text--no language other than Baum's has been used. This special edition is the perfect one to share with the youngest children.</p><p>In the 100 years since L. Frank Baum first published his <i>Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, countless authors and illustrators have adapted, interpreted, and retold this story of Dorothy and her unusual companions, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion. But for sheer opulence and sumptuous color, award-winning artist Charles Santore's 100th anniversary edition takes the cake. Santore's large, fairy-tale style watercolors feature ominous, shadowy forests, magnificent but deadly poppies, the whimsical, green-tinted landscapes of Oz, and the golden gray fields of Kansas. Each page is awash in color; many of the two-page spreads have no text to distract readers from the illustrations' myriad details--not-yet-blooming poppy buds, the Tin Woodman's watering can head, and the radiant good witch, Glinda, posing on her ruby-encrusted throne. The text is condensed rather than adapted; so virtually every word is Baum's own. Although some scenes have been left out, Baum's classic story rings through, loud and clear. Sharing this lush edition with a favorite child would be the perfect way to celebrate a century of Oz. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>PreSchool-Grade 4-- While not precisely a picture-book version, this title features full-color illustrations on every page and a considerably shortened text. Santore's paintings are striking and they effectively mirror the familiar adventures of Dorothy and her friends. Unfortunately, the abridgment of the text is less successful. Much is made of the fact that few additions were made, leaving much of Baum's language intact. However, the deletion of some descriptive and transitional phrases and of various events creates a text that is much flatter and less engaging than the original. While the brevity and brisk tone do make the story suitable for very young listeners, the danger exists that those who have enjoyed Santore's version will never experience the magic of Baum's complete work. This concern, of course, must be weighed against the fine quality of the artwork and the fact that the book will undoubtedly prove useful in many collections. The decision to include abridged texts rests with each library. For those who do include such items, this Wizard of Oz will be a worthwhile investment. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power</h2><p><b>&#x201c;We were sure that we would win, that we should score the first great triumph in a mighty world-movement.&#x201d;</b>&#x2014;<b>Theodore Roosevelt, 1904</b><br><br>Americans like to think they have no imperial past. In fact, the United States became an imperial nation within five short years a century ago (1898-1903), exploding onto the international scene with the conquest of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, and (indirectly) Panama. How did the nation become a player in world politics so suddenly&#x2014;and what inspired the move toward imperialism in the first place? <br><br>The renowned diplomat and writer Warren Zimmermann seeks answers in the lives and relationships of five remarkable figures: the hyper-energetic Theodore Roosevelt, the ascetic naval strategist Alfred T. Mahan, the bigoted and wily Henry Cabot Lodge, the self-doubting moderate Secretary of State John Hay, and the hard-edged corporate lawyer turned colonial administrator Elihu Root. Faced with difficult choices, these extraordinary men, all close friends, instituted new political and diplomatic policies with intermittent audacity, arrogance, generosity, paternalism, and vision.<br><br>Zimmermann's discerning account of these five men also examines the ways they exploited the readiness of the American people to support a surge of expansion overseas. He makes it clear why no discussion of America's international responsibilities today can be complete without understanding how the United States claimed its global powers a century ago.<br></p><p>A New York Times Notable Book of the Year for 2002 <p>"In the distinguished tradition of diplomat-historians like George Bancroft and George Kennan, Warren Zimmermann gives us a sensitive, insightful account of a moment when American leaders faced decisions that would shape world affairs for decades to come. Today, at another such moment, Zimmermann&#x2019;s story&#x2014;compelling in itself&#x2014;could hardly be more timely." </p><p>&#x2014;H. W. Brands, author of The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin </p><p>"First Great Triumph provides a fresh account&#x2014;balanced, lucid and informed&#x2014;of the origins and direction of early American imperialism. As Zimmermann recognizes, the impulses that generated the resulting adventures in the expansion of national power and domain remain a significant influence on current foreign policy." </p><p>&#x2014;John Morton Blum, Professor Emeritus, Yale University </p><p>"At a moment when Americans have become dramatically aware that they are citizens of an empire, no book could be more timely or illuminating than this engrossing study of our founding imperialists." </p><p>&#x2014;Ronald Steel, author of Walter Lippmann and the American Century </p><p>"The year 1898 marked a milestone in the American experience: the first time in its history that a burgeoning United States extended its power into the world beyond its borders. Warren Zimmermann recalls this momentous turning point through the lives of the five dynamic men who set the nation on its new course, which it still follows today. First Great Triumph is vivid, authoritative and, above all, readable." </p><p>&#x2014;Stanley Karnow, author of Vietnam: A History</p><b>Warren Zimmermann</b> spent thirty-three years as an officer in the U.S. Foreign Service, serving in France, Austria, Spain, Switzerland, Venezuela, the Soviet Union, and as our last ambassador to Yugoslavia.

Like Lady Chatterley's lover, he initiates her into the rites of sex and the stark, secret harmonies of his wilderness. She, in turn, awakens in him the pleasure of love. Then she mysteriously disappears, plunging him into desolation. </p><p><em>Black Sun</em> is a singular novel in Abbey's repertoire, a romantic story of a solitary man's passion for the outdoors and for a woman who is seeing the natural world's true colors for the first time. "Like most honest novels, <em>Black Sun</em> is partly autobiographical, mostly invention, and entirely true. The voice that speaks in this book is the passionate voice of the forest," Abbey writes, "the madness of desire, and the joy of love, and the anguish of final loss."</p><p>Edward Abbey spent most of his life in the American Southwest. He was the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including the celebrated Desert Solitaire, which decried the waste of America's wilderness, and the novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, the title of which is still in use today to describe groups that purposefully sabotage projects and entities that degrade the environment. Abbey was also one of the country's foremost defenders of the natural environment. He died in 1989.</p></p><h2>The Wench is Dead</h2><p>It is only to entertain himself in the hospital that the impatient Inspector Morse opens the little book called Murder on the Oxford Canal. But so fascinating is the story it tells--of the notorious 1859 murder of Joanna Franks aboard the canal boat Barbara Bray--that not even Morse&#39;s attractive nurses can distract him from it. Was Joanna really raped and murdered by fellow passengers? Morse believes the men hanged for the crime were innocent.

It has largely been successful. Rated the best country to visit in 2012, it was one named of the best tourist destinations of 2013 by <i>National Geographic</i> magazine. In addition to its game parks, home to the Big Five, Uganda has one of the largest numbers of recorded bird species of any country. It is also the home of the famed mountain gorillas, and the mighty Nile River provides some of the best whitewater rafting in the world. Add to this an almost perfect climate and spectacular sightseeing, including the source of the Nile, Murchison Falls, the &#x201c;little Switzerland&#x201d; of Kabale, the volcanic lakes, and the Rwenzori Mountains, and one can understand why Winston Churchill called Uganda &#x201c;the Pearl of Africa.&#x201d; But Uganda not only has wildlife and natural beauty to offer&#x2014;the Ugandan people are what makes it different. Drawn from over fifty tribes, they make up a rich blend of traditions. You can sample this in dance and song performances by groups such as the Ndere Troup, or you can wander through the capital city, or any village, and get to know the local people, as English is widely spoken. You will find them sociable, warm, and hospitable. Kampala is famous as the social capital of East Africa, the city that never sleeps, where every kind of nightlife is on offer, and Ugandans have now been officially rated the happiest people in East Africa! All this is what makes Uganda special. Inevitably there are cultural pitfalls for the unwary traveler&#x2014;differences in expectations, mores, and ways of behaving. This book provides key insights into Ugandan life and offers practical tips on how best to meet the Ugandan people on their own terms, vital information for tourists and businessmen alike.</p><p><b>Ian Clarke</b> has lived in Uganda for over twenty-five years.

Highly recommended!"<br>&#x2014;Douglas Brinkley, bestselling author of <em>The Wilderness Warrior</em> </p><p>The remarkable saga of America&#x2019;s landmark port of entry, from immigration post to deportation center to mythical icon.</p></p><p><p>For most of New York's early history, Ellis Island had been an obscure little island that barely held itself above high tide. Today the small island stands alongside Plymouth Rock in our nation's founding mythology as the place where many of our ancestors first touched American soil. Ellis Island's heyday&#x2014;from 1892 to 1924&#x2014;coincided with one of the greatest mass movements of individuals the world has ever seen, with some twelve million immigrants inspected at its gates. In <em>American Passage</em>, Vincent J. Cannato masterfully illuminates the story of Ellis Island from the days when it hosted pirate hangings witnessed by thousands of New Yorkers in the nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century when massive migrations sparked fierce debate and hopeful new immigrants often encountered corruption, harsh conditions, and political scheming. </p><p><em>American Passage</em> captures a time and a place unparalleled in American immigration and history, and articulates the dramatic and bittersweet accounts of the immigrants, officials, interpreters, and social reformers who all play an important role in Ellis Island's chronicle. Cannato traces the politics, prejudices, and ideologies that surrounded the great immigration debate, to the shift from immigration to detention of aliens during World War II and the Cold War, all the way to the rebirth of the island as a national monument. Long after Ellis Island ceased to be the nation's preeminent immigrant inspection station, the debates that once swirled around it are still relevant to Americans a century later. </p><p>In this sweeping, often heart-wrenching epic, Cannato reveals that the history of Ellis Island is ultimately the story of what it means to be an American. </p><p>Vincent J. Cannato teaches history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. He is the author of <em>The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York</em> and has written for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p></p><h2>Exploring the Psalms (2 Volume set)</h2><p>The psalms are rich in human experience. At times they ring with the din and noise of battle, at other times they take us with hushed hearts into the inner sanctuary, into the immediate presence of God. At times they set our hearts aflame and our feet dancing for joy, at times we turn to them when our face is drenched with tears. For the psalms touch all the notes in the keyboard of human emotion. Here we have love and hate, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, peace and strife, faith and despair. This is the stuff of which life is made. No wonder God&#39;s saints in all ages have felt the tug of the psalms. The book is a vast storehouse of human experience. There is one feature of this particular exposition which should appeal to general reader and student alike. Author Phillips has been very much aware that often a given psalm could be handled in several ways. He has tried, therefore, to vary the approach to the psalms. Sometimes he has thrown a psalm back into its historical setting and expounded it in the light of its author&#39;s own experiences - David&#39;s circumstances, Hezekiah&#39;s dilemma, Moses&#39; experience. Sometimes he has touched but lightly on the historical mold and emphasized the way a psalm relates to the life of a struggling soul today. Sometimes for the sake of variety, the author had taken the prophetic aspect of a psalm and handled it in the light of the coming great tribulation or the millennial reign of Christ. Some psalms are full-length prophecies revealing an astonishing picture of coming events. One problem many have found in approaching the psalms relates to their complicated structure. They seem to be especially difficult to analyze structurally and put in preachable form. As in all his other books, Phillips has given with each psalm a complete alliterated outline. He has been careful never to &#34;sacrifice the sense for the sake of the sound.&#34; The outlines will be found to be true to the text and a useful tool for preachers and Bible teachers.</p><p></p><h2>African Grey Parrots (Complete Pet Owner&#39;s Manuals)</h2><p>Among all parrot species, the African Grey is noted for its ability to speak following simple coaching.

First published in 1890, this collection of fairy tales contains the well-known English ones as well as British variants of stories common to many cultures.</p><p>In this first of Jacobs collections, many of the 43 tales will be familiar. Included are &#39;Jack and the Beanstalk, &#39; &#39;The Story of the Three Bears, &#39; and others.Born in Australia in 1854, Joseph Jacobs spent most of his adult life in England where he became, with Andrew Lang, a prominent member of the English Folk Lore Society founded in 1878. He spent ten years collecting from storytellers or printed sources the fairy tales that were first published in two volumes in 1890 and 1894 and now appear here in one Everyman&#x2019;s Library volume. Jacobs was a cheerful man, with a down-to-earth attitude towards fairy tales, which he regarded as &#x201c;essentially colloquial&#x201d; rather than romantic. Though his approach to collecting and recording material was scholarly, his telling of the tales was deliberately directed at young listeners, and he tried them out on his own three children.

Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas by Mafia contract killers hired by Louisiana mob boss Carlos Marcello. Kennedy was killed in that city because it was the only place in the country where a crime of that magnitude could be committed without fear of punishment. Long-time local district attorney Henry Wade, an LBJ crony who would have sole jurisdiction over the prosecution of those responsible, had been corrupted by the local Civello crime family. Lyndon B. Johnson, while a U.S. senator during the 1950s, had accepted bribes from the same mobsters so that they could avoid deportation.<br><br>With incredible detail and documentation, Mark North pieces the puzzle together to reveal how in late 1961, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy and his brother John, who hated LBJ, initiated a covert Organized Crime Task Force investigation of the Civello mob in Dallas. They understood that destroying the Dallas Mafia would also destroy LBJ. Johnson, through Wade and local federal officials he had placed in power, learned of the plan and cooperated with the Civello mob to have JFK killed. Johnson did this, in part, because he had the power to control any subsequent federal investigation via FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Johnson had leverage over Hoover because he had learned that the director and his assistant Clyde Tolson were lovers. After the Mafia killed JFK, Johnson stopped Robert Kennedy's prosecution of the Dallas Mafia.<br><br><i>Betrayal in Dallas</i> is unlike any book written on the JFK assassination. Because its conclusions are based on classified federal documents unknown to the public and research community, it will startle and convince all those who read it.

She is the author of the Invisible Library series, including <i>The Masked City</i> and <i>The Invisible Library</i>.The London air was full of smog and filth. Kai&#x2019;s senses were better than those of a human, though he tried not to be too smug about it. But even he couldn&#x2019;t see down a dark alley any better than the average Londoner. And even native Londoners walked carefully in the narrow streets behind King&#x2019;s Cross Station.<br> &nbsp;<br> But where crime flourished, so too did detectives. And he was here to meet Peregrine Vale, friend and fighter of crime.<br> &nbsp;<br> He paused to inspect a pawnbroker&#x2019;s window, trying to gauge the street behind him. While he couldn&#x2019;t see anyone specifically following him, there was something in the air that set him on edge, a foretaste of danger. But there were very few humans who could challenge a dragon, even in his human form, and he didn&#x2019;t expect to meet any of them in the back alleys here.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vale was in a warehouse just round the corner. Almost there, and then Kai could find out what kind of assistance Vale needed with his case.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then someone screamed nearby. It was a woman&#x2019;s scream, genuinely terrified, cut off in the middle with a coughing yelp. Kai turned abruptly, peering into the swirling fog. Two men and a woman were huddled at one end of a particularly dank passageway. The woman had her arms pinned behind her back by one aggressor, while the other was drawing back his fist to strike again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let her go,&#x201d; Kai said calmly. He could handle two humans easily enough. Even if they were werewolves, they weren&#x2019;t a significant danger. But this would make him late.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Back off,&#x201d; one of the men snarled, turning away from the woman to face him. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t none of your business, nor your part of town, neither.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my business if I choose to make it my business.&#x201d; Kai advanced down the alley towards the group, automatically assessing them as his father&#x2019;s arms-masters had trained him to. The men were muscular in the shoulders, well built, but both showed signs of a paunch and dissipation. He could take them, just as he&#x2019;d taken others of their kind a few days before.<br> &nbsp;<br> The free man advanced towards him, fists up in a crude boxer&#x2019;s stance. He was lighter on his feet than Kai had expected, but not fast enough. He bluffed with his right fist, then tried a straight left at Kai&#x2019;s jaw. Kai sidestepped, slammed his hand sideways into the man&#x2019;s kidneys, kicked him in the back of the knee to take him off balance, and ran his head into the wall. The man went down.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t be like that,&#x201d; the other man said, backing deeper into the alley and holding the woman in front of him like a shield. Panic was starting to show in his eyes. &#x201c;You just walk away and nobody gets hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You just let go of that woman,&#x201d; Kai corrected him, &#x201c;and you don&#x2019;t get hurt.&#x201d; He walked forward, considering his openings. A dodge to the side and a strike to the man&#x2019;s neck might be the least risky option for the woman, and yet&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; a voice said from above.<br> &nbsp;<br> Doors slammed open on either side of him and behind him, and at the same moment something fell from above, tumbling down towards him in a knot of shadows. Kai dived to one side on instinct, but then there were too many men in the alley with him. A dozen of them, the combat-trained part of his mind noted, and more behind those open doors. He had no room to dodge, and it looked like a trap. They didn&#x2019;t even hang back and let other people take the first blows, in the normal manner of thugs. They came charging in, most of them barehanded, but a couple with knuckledusters or small weighted saps.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had to get back and out. There was no shame to it. Part of a warrior&#x2019;s training was acknowledging superior force and reacting appropriately. An arm came around his neck from behind. He grabbed it, went down on one knee, and flung the man over his head and into the ones closing in on him. Staying low, he pivoted, bringing a foot round and scything another combatant&#x2019;s feet from under him. He used the momentum to turn and rise. Four men were between him and the way out. Four obstacles to remove.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vale&#x2019;s case must be important to warrant this sort of interference.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kai noted the coils of the net, which had barely missed him, tangled on the street. It was a nasty piece of work, with metal woven into the ropes. Curious. Why go to this trouble to snare him personally? If they had already caught Vale, they would regret it.<br> &nbsp;<br> He slammed an elbow backwards, feeling the jolt as it connected with a chin, and started forward at a swinging run. At least one of the men in front of him should back away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;<br> He didn&#x2019;t expect them to all come at him at once, like a sudden human tidal wave. He struck high for a throat, and then low to a groin&#x2014;disabling blows. But they weren&#x2019;t going down. They felt the pain, they grunted, they staggered, but they were still in his path.<br> &nbsp;<br> A blow took him across the back of the head, causing a sudden burst of pain, and his attempted nerve-strike lost its force as he went down on one knee. He knew that he was a sitting target, but for that moment his muscles wouldn&#x2019;t respond.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another man hit him in the face. He spat blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man behind him threw himself on top of Kai, bringing him down to the filthy pavement. Kai struggled for breath, sparks still dancing in his vision. He could feel pure fury running through his veins now. How dare these humans assault him like this?<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no room in him for fear. It was not possible that this scum could win.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt his natural body assert itself, his hands becoming claws, scales beginning to trace their way across his skin as his true nature rose with that fury. He would call up the river against them; he would scour them from this London; he would make them pay for this insolence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Across London, he felt the Thames and all its tributaries stir in response to his anger. He might be the least and youngest of his father&#x2019;s sons, but he was still a dragon of the royal house. With an uncoiling shove, he thrust backwards, forcing the thug from his back and away, and pushed himself up, teeth bared in a snarl.<br> &nbsp;<br> More bodies hit him and took him down, heavy hands pinning his wrists to the pavement. His claws left marks in it as he struggled for leverage. For the first time he felt a prickle of doubt. Perhaps it would be wiser to fully take on his true form, one that they could not possibly restrain. It would alert all London that a dragon walked in their midst, but if he should lose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;<br> A hand snarled itself in his hair, pulling his head back, and he felt cold metal snap shut around his neck. And now abruptly there was the ferocious, electric tang of Fae magic in the air, locked around him, binding him. He cried out in sudden shock as the distant rivers faded and were gone from his senses, as his fingers, now purely human, scraped against the concrete.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That should do it.&#x201d; That cold voice was the first time that anyone had spoken during the whole attack, and it was the last thing Kai heard. There was one final blow to his head, and then he surrendered to unconsciousness.</p><h2>Allah&#39;s Scorpion (McGarvey)</h2><p>Under the cover of a moonless night, al-Quaida operatives&nbsp;made their way inside the infamous Camp Delta prison on the American base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&nbsp;Their goal was&nbsp;to free&nbsp;five prisoners. But&nbsp;their attempt fails. The rescuers and prisoners, all former Iranian Navy submarine crewmen, were all killed. Their freedom was to be&nbsp;the first step&nbsp;in&nbsp;unleashing a deadly act of terrorism--a mission codenamed Allah's Scorpion.The CIA and Kirk McGarvey are called in, but&nbsp;first McGarvey must stop the destruction of the Panama Canal by a Venezuelan oil tanker rigged to explode in one of the locks.&nbsp;What seems to be an unrelated attack turns up the same cryptic code name.But this mission may prove to be the ultimate strike against America, a grand finale to what began on 9/11.&nbsp;A pair of Russian nuclear warhead missiles that were&nbsp;spirited into Lybia just before the invasion of Iraq have turned up on the radar, and they are&nbsp;in transit by sea to a undisclosed launch site in the Atlantic Ocean. Once again, Kirk McGarvey is the only man in the position to stop them--the only man capable of knocking out Allah's Scorpion.</p><p>DAVID HAGBERG is a former Air Force cryptographer who has traveled extensively in Europe, the Arctic, and the Caribbean and has spoken at CIA functions. He has published more than twenty novels of suspense, including the bestselling<i> High Flight, Assassin,</i> and <i>Joshua's Hammer.</i> He makes his home in Sarasota, Florida.Allah's Scorpion<br>PART ONEONE&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>CABIMAS, VENEZUELANo one looked twice at the Russian sea captain as he got out of his cab in front of the Cabimas Hotel Internacional, paid the fare, and headed toward the lobby. Nor did any of the smartly uniformed bellmen stationed at the front doors offer to help with his battered leather satchel and matching garment bag. He smiled inwardly. He was used to such treatment, he didn't have the look of a successful man. And this was a busy town of important oil executives, heavy hitters, big money.He had the typical broad shoulders and barrel chest of a Great Russian, but his face was surprisingly round, with a delicate nose and soft, almost dreamy eyes under short dark hair that made him look like a poet-soldier. He carried his five-feet-ten like a man long accustomed to being at sea; on the balls of his feet, as if he were constantly working to keep a perfect balance.The captain entered the deluxe hotel, and crossed the busy lobby to stand in line at the registration desk. He'd never stayed here before, but the woman at GAC-Vensport had booked a suite for him. Nothing but first class for the new captain of the Panamax oil tanker <i>Apurto Devl�n.</i> In the morning he would be helicoptered out to his ship, currently loading crude, but this evening he would live in the lap of luxury and enjoy it.When it was the captain's turn, one of the clerks, a haughty young man in a crisply tailored blue blazer, motioned him up to the desk. "Do you have reservations?""Yes," the captain said. He smiled faintly. Aboard his crude carrier he would be the undisputed lord and master, but the moment he stepped ashore and interacted with civilians he became a nobody. His wife, Tania, back in St. Petersburg, bought him expensive clothes in Helsinki and Paris, but on him even designer labels looked shabby.He handed over his Russian passport, which identified him as Grigoriy Ivanovich Slavin.The clerk handled the passport as if he thought his hands would get dirty. He glanced at the photograph and looked up at Slavin. All of a sudden something apparently dawned on him, because his face fell. He laid the passport down and quickly typed something into his computer. He looked up again, a broad smile plastered across his stricken features. "<i>Captain</i> Slavin, we were not expecting you so early.""Well, I'm here," Slavin said. "Is my room ready, or will I have to wait?""Of course not, sir. Your <i>suite</i> is at your immediate disposal." The clerk laid a registration card on the counter and handed Slavin a pen. "If you will sign in, sir, I'll have your bags taken up and personally escort you.""Not necessary," Slavin said curtly. He signed the card and laid the pen on the counter. He preferred being a nobody ashore, because he didn't like being fawned over. Aboard ship he gave orders and his officers and crew followed them. No questions, no bargaining, no diplomacy. It was the discipline he enjoyed.The clerk handed back his passport, and motioned for a young, handsome bellman, who scurried over from the bell station near the front doors. The clerk passed him a plastic key card. "Take <i>Capitano</i> Slavin's bags to the Bol�var Suite.""It's not necessary," Slavin growled.The clerk was suddenly nervous. "Sir, it's hotel policy for all VIP guests. GAC-Vensport expects no less from us." His rigid smile broadened. The company was responsible for all of Venezuela's oil shipping, which was the major source of the nation's income. It was big.Slavin remembered one of the old Russian proverbs his <i>babushka</i> used to use when the family was poor. <i>We're all related, the same sun dries our rags.</i> He nodded. <i>"Da."</i>The clerk gave him a relieved look and he came around from behind the counter as the bellman disappeared with Slavin's bags. "Just this way, sir," he said, and he escorted the captain across the soaring atrium lobby to a bank of elevators."A helicopter is coming for me at oh-eight-hundred.""Yes, sir, we'll let you know when it's twenty minutes out," the clerk said. The hotel provided helicopter service with Maracaibo's La ChinitaAirport eight minutes away, and to the ships loading at fueling platforms out in the lake.Slavin was impressed despite himself. In the Russian navy such perks were reserved for flag officers, and during his eleven-year career in the merchant marine he'd never had the privilege of such treatment. At 275 meters on the waterline with a beam of nearly forty-four meters, his new command, the <i>Apurto Devl�n,</i> was the largest crude carrier that could transit the Panama Canal, and the largest and most important vessel he'd ever been given responsibility for. He'd transited the canal ten times before aboard smaller ships, three times as skipper of container vessels, but being helicoptered out to a ship of his own would be a first. He decided that he would try to loosen up and savor the moment. It was the other thing Tania had tried to change in him; he didn't know how to relax.When they reached the top floor, the clerk held the elevator door for Slavin, and then led the way to the suite at the end of the plushly carpeted corridor, where he opened the door. "I believe that you will find these rooms to your liking, Captain."Slavin suppressed a grin. "This will do," he said.The suite's sitting room was very large, furnished luxuriously with long leather couches, massive chairs, and dining-table-sized coffee tables facing an electronic media complex that featured a huge plasma television hanging on the richly paneled wall. The opposite side of the room was equipped with a wet bar, a dining area for eight, and a home office corner. Recessed lighting softly illuminated the artwork on the walls and on display tables here and there. A sweeping staircase led upstairs.The clerk went across the room, touched a button, and heavy drapes that covered the entire rear wall opened, revealing a stunning view of Lake Maracaibo through floor-to-ceiling windows. "At night when an electrical storm crosses the lake, it's quite spectacular from this vantage point," he said breezily."What's upstairs?""The master bedroom, his and hers bathrooms and dressing rooms, an exercise area, a balcony, and, of course, a Jacuzzi."The bellman arrived with Slavin's bags. "Shall I unpack for you, sir?" he asked."No need, I'm only staying the night. Put them on the bed.""Very well, sir," the bellman said, and he took the bags upstairs.The clerk crossed the room to the wet bar, where a bottle of Dom P�rignon was cooling in a bucket of ice. He opened the champagne, poured a glass, and brought it to Slavin. "Compliments of the hotel, Captain," he said.The wine was sour to Slavin's taste, but he said nothing. The clerk was watching him closely for a reaction. In the old days, to be caught reacting in the wrong way or doing something that was socially inept was to be <i>nekulturny.</i> He'd never forgotten his lessons in humility at the Frunze Military Academy, where on the first evening in the dining room he'd been taught the proper use of the linen napkin and numerous utensils.<i>Once a word is out of your mouth, his grandmother used to say, you can't swallow it again. He'd learned the hard way.</i>The bellman came downstairs. Slavin set his wineglass aside, and reached for his wallet, but the clerk shook his head. "That will not be necessary, sir. Vensport is taking care of everything.""I didn't know," Slavin said to cover his mild embarrassment. Tomorrow would not come soon enough.The clerk handed over the plastic card key. "I hope that you enjoy your brief stay with us, Captain. My name is Mr. Angarita. If there is anything that you need don't hesitate to call me.""Thank you," Slavin said."Our La Terraza restaurant by the pool is first-class. Shall I make reservations for you?""I'll decide later.""As you wish, sir."When the clerk was gone, Slavin took his champagne back to the wet bar and emptied it into the small sink. He found a bottle of Stolichnaya and a glass, and poured a stiff measure of the Russian vodka. He knocked it back, poured another, and then, jamming the bottle in his coat pocket, headed upstairs while loosening his tie with one hand.The master bedroom was just as grand as the sitting room, with a huge circular bed facing large floor-to-ceiling sliding-glass doors that opened to the balcony. It was midafternoon and the late-afternoon sun was low behind the hotel, casting a beautiful gold light across the lake. At this point the west shore was fifty kilometers away, lost in the mist, but the view was spectacular. The two-hundred-kilometer-long lake was studded with oil drilling platforms, waste gas burning in long, wind-driven jets offire from many of them; broad loading platforms where tankers bound for refineries all over the world loaded Venezuelan sweet light crude; and the ships themselves, outbound for the Golfo de Venezuela and the open Caribbean, or inbound under the five-mile General Rafael Urdaneta high bridge at the neck of the lake to take on their cargoes.<i>"Yob tvoyu mat,"</i> Slavin swore softly. <i>Fuck your mother.</i> He raised a toast. Tania had computed that he had been at sea for twenty-one and a half of the twenty-four years they'd been married. She never complained, in part because the money was very good. But just lately she'd started to ask him about an early retirement. Not to quit the sea, rather she wanted to travel with him to some of the places he'd told her about, as civilians, as tourists, as lovers.God help him, he did love it. And maybe he would do what she asked, retire before he turned fifty. But not to give up the sea, just to voyage differently. It was an intriguing thought.He poured another drink and went into the whorehouse of a bathroom, where he found the Jacuzzi controls and started the jets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Slavin was slightly drunk. Lying in the Jacuzzi, he'd finished the first bottle of vodka, and then, dripping wet, had padded downstairs to fetch a second bottle from the bar. That had been two hours ago, and that bottle was nearly empty. He was finally beginning to relax after the long air trip from Moscow to Paris with Tania, and from there across the Atlantic to Caracas, and finally the short hop up to Maracaibo.Air travel was fast, relatively safe, and cheap these days, but no aluminum tube with wings, into which a couple hundred passengers were crammed like sardines for endless hours, could ever replace an oceangoing vessel in which a man had more room than even in his apartment ashore.It was starting to get dark out on the lake. The waste gas flames, combined with the oil derricks and platform lights, and the lights on the ships, made a kaleidoscope of ever-changing colors and patterns that was comforting. Like watching waves coming ashore, or burning logs in a fireplace.Someone came into the bathroom. Slavin saw the reflection in the window glass and turned.For a moment he thought it was the idiot clerk again. A man of moderate height, dressed in a dark jacket and open-necked shirt, stood in the doorway, longish blond hair around his ears, with a round face and darkglasses hiding his eyes. The intruder wore latex surgical gloves, and it began to dawn on Slavin that something was very wrong."Who are you--?"The man brought a small-caliber silenced pistol from where he'd concealed it behind his back, raised it, and fired one shot. Something like a hammer struck Slavin in his head, and a billion stars burst inside his brain.Copyright � 2006 by David Hagberg</p><h2>The Great republic: A history of the American people</h2><p>&#34;This book is a history of the American people, from the earliest settlements in the New World to the 200th anniversary of the birth of the United States as a nation&#34; - The Authors</p><p></p><h2>Amish Quilts and the Welsh Connection</h2><p>This new reference book examines the common features of quilts made by the Amish in America and the Welsh in Britain.

Whenever Norman gets the spotlight, the novel feels like a lost Bloch work.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br>The original <i>Psycho </i>novel by Robert Bloch was published in 1959 and became an instant hit, leading to the smash movie only a year later, which brought Norman Bates's terrifying story into the public consciousness, where it still remains (proven by the success of the tv series, Bates Motel). It took Bloch 23 years to write another <i>Psycho </i>novel, revealing that Norman had been in a mental institution the entire time. In that sequel, Norman quickly escapes the sanitarium and goes on a killing spree in Hollywood.</p><p>But what happened in that asylum during those two decades? Until now, no one has known.</p><p>It's 1960. Norman Bates is in the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and it's up to Dr. Felix Reed to bring him out of his catatonic state.</p><p>But Norman and Dr. Reed have obstacles in twisted fellow patients and staff members who think of the institution as a prison rather than a place of healing. And the greatest obstacle is the building itself, once a private sanitarium, rumored to be haunted. A wild card appears in the persona of Robert Newman, Norman's twin brother, taken away at birth after the attending doctor pronounced him brain damaged. As Robert and Norman grow to know each other, Norman senses a darkness in Robert, even deeper than that which has lurked in Norman himself.</p><p>Soon, murders begin to occur and a shocking chain of events plunge us even deeper into the deranged madness inside the walls of <i>Psycho: Sanitarium</i>.</p></p><p>CHET WILLIAMSON's parents took him to see the film of Robert Bloch's <i>Psycho </i>when he was twelve, and he has been a reader and disciple of Bloch ever since.

The novel shines when he focuses on Norman and both his internal struggles with his &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; personality and his awkwardness around his newfound sibling.

In this collection of Whelan's cover illustrations for some 50 booksnotably all published by Del ReyIsaac Asimov's robots, Edgar Rice Burroughs's martians, H. P. Lovecraft's skeletons, Anne McCaffrey's flying dragons and the Star Child of Arthur C. Clarke's 2010: Odyssey Two are rendered in brilliant hues and careful detail. Unfortunately, Whelan's descriptive talents do not extend to his writing, which is artless. Furthermore, since he assumes, apparently, that readers are intimately familiar with the books in question, his decision to give a white lizard six legs rather than eight in one cover painting and his explanation that red lilies represent the Earth Goddess, regeneration and immortality in another picture will be meaningful only to connoisseurs of the genre. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Knight: A Novelization</h2><p>A retelling of the story of Lancelot and Guinevere includes each character from the original legend and finds the doomed lovers and their king in battle against the murderous Malagant</p><p></p><h2>The Habsburgs: Embodying Empire</h2><p>For a Habsburg, there was no limit to possibility: Maximilian I could dream of being both Pope and Holy Roman Emperor; Ferdinand II could imagine turning back the tide of Protestantism, and cheerfully risk drowning Europe in blood to achieve that miracle; and Francis I would fashion a cosy Biedermeier world, in which all children had rosy cheeks and all milkmaids were pretty and demure.

There is less about the lands and peoples that were ruled, and more about the rulers themselves, both as individuals and collectively. Andrew Wheatcroft uses the techniques of the archaeologist, scraping through the strata of past lives to rediscover the Habsburgs' own scale of values, their concerns, their totems and their fetishes. He explores how and why the Habsburgs have survived and how they are now moving confidently towards a new century, as ever imbued with their own curious and convoluted version of eternal life.</p><p>Andrew Wheatcroft teaches in the Department of English at the University of Stirling.</p><h2>Islamic Tiles</h2><p>This series focuses on the most important forms of Eastern art, providing a survey of the major stylistic and technical developments and the historical events which influenced them. Ceramic tiles have been produced for over 1,000 years in the Islamic world, from Iraq in the ninth century to Turkey in the 19th. The wealth of designs and colours used to decorate mosques, shrines and palaces also became a rich source of inspiration for European artists and designers. This book explains the techniques of the craftsmen including the invention of lustre and the use of blue and white, and traces the development of tilework across a wide geographic area, beginning with the pre-Islamic tradition. Later decorative trends followed those of other forms of Islamic art, ranging from the influence of Chinese ornament to the glorification of the word of God through beautiful calligraphy.</p><p>Venetia Porter has worked on the Islamic collections in the Department of Oriental Antiquities and is now a curator in the Department of Coins &amp; Medals in the British Museum.</p><h2>The Effective Executive</h2><p><p>The measure of the executive, Peter Drucker reminds us, is the ability to "get the right things done."

Cavendon Hall is home to two families, the aristocratic Inghams and the Swanns who serve them. Charles Ingham, the sixth Earl of Mowbray, lives there with his wife Felicity and their six children. Walter Swann, the premier male of the Swann family, is valet to the earl. His wife Alice, a clever seamstress who is in charge of the countess's wardrobe, also makes clothes for the four daughters. For centuries, these two families have lived side-by-side, beneath the backdrop of the imposing Yorkshire manor. Lady Daphne, the most beautiful of the Earl's daughters, is about to be presented at court when a devastating event changes her life and threatens the Ingham name. With World War I looming, both families will find themselves tested in ways they never thought possible. Loyalties will be challenged and betrayals will be set into motion. In this time of uncertainty, one thing is sure: these two families will never be the same again. <br><i>Cavendon Hall</i> is Barbara Taylor Bradford at her very best, and its sweeping story of secrets, love, honor, and betrayal will have readers riveted up to the very last page.</p></p><p><p>BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD was born and brought up in England, where she started her writing career as a journalist. She has written twenty-eight international bestsellers. <i>Cavendon Hall</i> is her twenty-ninth novel. In 2007 Queen Elizabeth awarded her the OBE for her literary achievements. She lives in New York with her husband, television, and film producer Robert Bradford.</p><i>One</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Cecily Swann was excited. She had been given a special task to do by her mother, and she couldn&#x2019;t wait to start. She hurried along the dirt path, walking toward Cavendon Hall, all sorts of ideas running through her active young mind. She was going to examine some beautiful dresses, looking for flaws; it was an important task, her mother had explained, and only she could do it. <br>She did not want to be late, and increased her pace. She had been told to be there at ten o&#x2019;clock sharp, and ten o&#x2019;clock it would be. <br>Her mother, Alice Swann, often pointed out that punctuality might easily be her middle name, and this was always said with a degree of admiration. Alice took great pride in her daughter, and was aware of certain unique talents she possessed. <br>Although Cecily was only twelve, she seemed much older in some ways, and capable, with an unusual sense of responsibility. Everyone considered her to be rather grown-up, more so than most girls of her age, and reliable. <br>Lifting her eyes, Cecily looked up the slope ahead of her. Towering on top of the hill was Cavendon, one of the greatest stately homes in England and something of a masterpiece. <br>After Humphrey Ingham, the First Earl of Mowbray, had purchased thousands of acres in the Yorkshire Dales, he had commissioned two extraordinary architects to design the house: John Carr of York, and the famous Robert Adam. <br>It was finished in 1761. Lancelot &#x201c;Capability&#x201d; Brown then created the landscaped gardens, which were ornate and beautiful, and had remained intact to this day. Close to the house was a man-made ornamental lake, and water gardens at the back of the house. <br>Cecily had been going to the hall since she was a small child, and to her it was the most beautiful place in the world. She knew every inch of it, as did her father, Walter Swann. Her father was valet to the earl, just as his father had been before him, and his great-uncle Henry before that. <br>The Swanns of Little Skell village had been working at the big house for over 160 years, generations of them, ever since the days of the first earl in the eighteenth century. The two families were closely intertwined and bound together, and the Swanns had many privileges, and were exceedingly loyal to the Inghams. Walter always said he&#x2019;d take a bullet for the earl, and meant it sincerely. <br>Hurrying along, preoccupied with her thoughts, Cecily was suddenly startled and stopped abruptly. A figure had jumped out onto the path in front of her, giving her a shock. Then she saw at once that it was the young gypsy woman called Genevra, who often lurked around these parts. <br>The Romany stood in the middle of the path, grinning hugely, her hands on her hips, her dark eyes sparkling. <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have done that!&#x201d; Cecily exclaimed, stepping sideways swiftly. &#x201c;You startled me. Where did you spring from, Genevra?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yonder,&#x201d; the gypsy answered, waving her arm toward the long meadow. &#x201c;I see yer coming, liddle Cecily. I wus behind t&#x2019;wall.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have to get on. I don&#x2019;t want to be late,&#x201d; Cecily said in a cool, dismissive voice. She endeavored to step around the young woman without success. <br>The gypsy dodged about, blocked her way, muttering, &#x201c;Aye. Yer bound for that owld &#x2019;ouse up yonder. Gimme yer &#x2019;and and I&#x2019;ll tell yer fortune.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t cross your palm with silver, I don&#x2019;t even have a ha&#x2019;penny,&#x201d; Cecily said. <br>&#x201c;I doan want yer money, and I&#x2019;ve no need to see yer &#x2019;and, I knows all about yer.&#x201d; <br>Cecily frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand&#x2026;&#x201d; She let her voice drift off, impatient to be on her way, not wanting to waste any more time with the gypsy. <br>Genevra was silent, but she threw Cecily a curious look, then turned, stared up at Cavendon. Its many windows were glittering and the pale stone walls shone like polished marble in the clear northern light on this bright May morning. In fact, the entire house appeared to have a sheen. <br>The Romany knew this was an illusion created by the sunlight. Still, Cavendon did have a special aura about it. She had always been aware of that. For a moment she remained standing perfectly still, lost in thought, still gazing at Cavendon&nbsp;&#x2026; she had the gift, the gift of sight. And she saw the future. Not wanting to be burdened with this sudden knowledge, she closed her eyes, shutting it all out. <br>Eventually the gypsy swung back to face Cecily, blinking in the light. She stared at the twelve-year-old for the longest moment, her eyes narrowing, her expression serious. <br>Cecily was acutely aware of the gypsy&#x2019;s fixed scrutiny, and said, &#x201c;Why are you looking at me like that? What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nowt,&#x201d; the gypsy muttered. &#x201c;Nowt&#x2019;s wrong, liddle Cecily.&#x201d; Genevra bent down, picked up a long twig, began to scratch in the dirt. She drew a square, and then above the square she made the shape of a bird, then glanced at Cecily pointedly. <br>&#x201c;What do they mean?&#x201d; the child asked. <br>&#x201c;Nowt.&#x201d; Genevra threw the twig down, her black eyes soulful. And in a flash, her strange, enigmatic mood vanished. She began to laugh, and danced across toward the drystone wall. <br>Placing both hands on the wall, she threw her legs up in the air, cartwheeled over the wall, and landed on her feet in the field. <br>After she had adjusted the red bandana tied around her dark curls, she skipped down the long meadow and disappeared behind a copse of trees. Her laughter echoed across the stillness of the fields, even though now she was no longer in sight. <br>Cecily shook her head, baffled by the gypsy&#x2019;s odd behavior, and bit her lip. Then she quickly scuffled her feet in the dirt, obliterating the gypsy&#x2019;s symbols, and continued up the slope. <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s always been strange,&#x201d; Cecily muttered under her breath as she walked on. She knew that Genevra lived with her family in one of the two painted Romany wagons which stood on the far side of the bluebell woods, way beyond the long meadow. She also knew that the Romany tribe was not trespassing. <br>It was the Earl of Mowbray&#x2019;s land where they were camped, and he had given them permission to stay there in the warm weather. They always vanished in the winter months; where they went nobody knew. <br>The Romany family had been coming to Cavendon for a long time. It was Miles who had told her that. He was the earl&#x2019;s second son, had confided that he didn&#x2019;t know why his father was so nice to the gypsies. Miles was fourteen; he and his sister DeLacy were Cecily&#x2019;s best friends. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The dirt path through the fields led directly from Little Skell village to the backyard of Cavendon Hall. Cecily was running across the cobblestones of the yard when the clock in the stable block tower began to strike the hour. It was exactly ten o&#x2019;clock and she was not late. <br>Cook&#x2019;s cheerful Yorkshire voice was echoing through the back door as Cecily stood for a moment catching her breath, and listening. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stand there gawping like a sucking duck, Polly,&#x201d; Cook was exclaiming to the kitchen maid. &#x201c;And for goodness&#x2019; sake, push the metal spoon into the flour jar before you add the lid. Otherwise we&#x2019;re bound to get weevils in the flour!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Cook,&#x201d; Polly muttered. <br>Cecily smiled to herself. She knew the reprimand didn&#x2019;t mean much. Her father said Cook&#x2019;s bark was worse than her bite, and this was true. Cook was a good soul, motherly at heart. <br>Turning the doorknob, Cecily went into the kitchen, to be greeted by great wafts of steam, warm air, and the most delicious smells emanating from the bubbling pans. Cook was already preparing lunch for the family. <br>Swinging around at the sound of the door opening, Cook smiled broadly when she saw Cecily entering her domain. &#x201c;Hello, luv,&#x201d; she said in a welcoming way. Everyone knew that Cecily was her favorite; she made no bones about that. <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mrs. Jackson,&#x201d; Cecily answered, and glanced at the kitchen maid. &#x201c;Hello, Polly.&#x201d; <br>Polly nodded, and retreated into a corner, as usual shy and awkward when addressed by Cecily. <br>&#x201c;Mam sent me to help with the frocks for Lady Daphne,&#x201d; Cecily explained. <br>&#x201c;Aye, I knows that. So go on then, luv, get along with yer. Lady DeLacy is waiting upstairs for yer. I understand she&#x2019;s going to be yer assistant.&#x201d; As she spoke Cook chuckled and winked at Cecily conspiratorially. <br>Cecily laughed. &#x201c;Mam will be here about eleven.&#x201d; <br>The cook nodded. &#x201c;Yer&#x2019;ll both be having lunch down here with us. And yer father. A special treat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be nice, Mrs. Jackson.&#x201d; Cecily continued across the kitchen, heading for the back stairs that led to the upper floors of the great house. <br>Nell Jackson watched her go, her eyes narrowing slightly. The twelve-year-old girl was lovely. Suddenly, she saw in that innocent young face the woman she would become. A real beauty. And a true Swann. No mistaking where she came from, with those high cheekbones, ivory complexion, and the lavender eyes&nbsp;&#x2026; Pale, smoky, bluish-gray eyes. The Swann trademark. And then there was that abundant hair. Thick, luxuriant, russet brown shot through with reddish lights. She&#x2019;ll be the spitting image of Charlotte when she grows up, Cook thought, and sighed to herself. What a wasted life <i>she&#x2019;d</i> had, <i>Charlotte Swann</i>. She could have gone far, no two ways about that. I hope the girl doesn&#x2019;t stay here, like her aunt did, Nell now thought, turning around, stirring one of her pots. Run, Cecily, run. Run for your life. And don&#x2019;t look back. Save yourself. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Beaji Enterprises, Inc. <br></p><h2>Emily Dickinson</h2><p>Traces the life of the nineteenth-century American poet and analyzes all of her major poems</p><p><b>Cynthia Griffin Wolff</b> holds the Class of 1922 Professorship of the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is the author of <i>A Feast of Words: The Triumph of Edith Wharton</i> and <i>Samuel Richardson and the Eighteenth Century Puritan Character.</i>One hundred years after Emily Dickinson's death, the Amherst poet's life and work are increasingly the subjects of scholarly study and imaginative interpretation. Wolff, professor of humanities at MIT, presents within the framework of a life not long and not outwardly eventful an acute, erudite analysis of the sources and voices of the remarkable, individual, cryptic and often breathtaking poetry. Dickinson is seen here not as a timid woman who withdrew from life, but as a strong person aware of her talent and of the power of language, who chose to spend her time and energy on the writing and perfecting of poetry. The major part of the book identifies and analyzes subjects and influences, among them: the recurrent waves of religious revival in the mid-19th century, which Dickinson alone among her family and close associates resisted; the close observation of nature, sometimes ironic, sometimes playful; the fear of blindness, with its threatened loss of the joy of reading; the reciprocated but unfulfilled love for Judge Otis Phillips Lord late in life; the struggle to grasp and deal with the fact of death that produced some of her greatest work. In transmitting the quality of Dickinson, Wolff enlarges on a comment by Archibald MacLeish, that the person reading her is "not so much reading as being spoken to. . . . " Among the poetic voices described are those of the child, the wife, the voice of "No" and the proleptic voice: "I felt a Funeral, in my brain . . . . " A striking piece of explication is "Interlude: Context and Subject," in which the poet, in her attempt to perfect her art, appears as a Jacob-like figure wrestling with the Angel, even as an Ahab. This powerful book is rich in equally provocative analogies and insights. Photos.

He lives in Italy.Starred Review. The Renaissance, so often seen as a clean break with the medieval past, was really an age of creative ambivalence and paradox. In this marvelously fresh addition to the Enterprise series, Parks, author of the Booker-listed <i>Europa</i> and a literary observer of modern Italian life, turns to Florence and to a particularly compelling contradiction. The spirit of capitalist enterprise that fostered cultural originality and underpinned patronage was accompanied by a Christian conviction that money was a source of evil and that usury was a damnable spiritual offense. In the space where this cultural conflict plays out, sometimes as stylized as one of Lorenzo Il Magnifico's tournaments, sometimes as life-threateningly fiery as Savonarola's sermons against worldly vanities, we find a world both akin to our own and almost incomprehensibly distant. Parks is a clear-eyed guide to the ambiguities of Florentine culture, equally attentive to the intricacies of international exchange rates, the spiritual neurosis about unearned income, the shocking bawdiness of Lorenzo's carnival songs and the realpolitik of 15th-century power. His prose is swift and economical, cutting to the chase. Like the Medici-commissioned funerary monument for the anti-Pope John XXIII, the effect is startlingly vibrant, resembling "those moments in Dante's <i>Inferno</i> when one of the damned ceases merely to represent this or that sin and becomes a man or woman with a complex story, someone we are interested in, sympathetic towards." <i>(May) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It ended with that same army fleeing back in near total disarray -- and Hooker's reputation in ruins.<br><br>This splendid account of Chancellorsville -- the first in more than 35 years -- explains Lee's most brilliant victory even as it places the battle within the larger canvas of the Civil War. Drawing on a wealth of first-hand sources, it creates a novelistic chronicle of tactics and characters while it retraces every thrust and parry of the two armies and the fateful decisions of their commanders, from Hooker's glaring display of moral weakness to the inspired risk-taking of Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who was mortally wounded by friendly fire. At once impassioned and gracefully balanced, Chancellorsville 1863 is a grand achievement in Civil War history.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#34;This eloquent narrative will become the standard study....It captures both the human drama and the tactical complexity of the battle in lucid, sparkling, prose.&#34;--James M.

A spring dawn on Flamborough Head, where the rock of the Yorkshire Wolds juts out into the North Sea like a gigantic fishhook, millions of tons in weight. Pointing out to sea, pointing to the ever-present threat of the Vikings. Now the kings of the little kingdoms were uneasily beginning to draw together against this threat from the North. Uneasy and jealous, remembering the long hostilities and the trail of murder that had marked the history of the Angles and the Saxons ever since they came here centuries ago. Proud warsmiths who overcame the Welsh, noble warriors who--as the poets say--obtained the land.Godwin the Thane cursed to himself as he paced the wooden palisade of the little fort erected on the very tip of Flamborough Head itself. Spring! Maybe in more fortunate parts the lengthening days and the light evenings meant greenery and buttercups and heavy-uddered cows trooping to the byres to be milked. Here on the Head it meant wind. It meant the equinoctial gales and the nor'easter blowing. Behind him the low, gnarled trees stood in line, one behind the other like men with their backs turned, each successive one a few inches higher than the one to windward, so that they formed natural wind-arrows or weathercocks, pointing out to the tormented sea. On three sides all round him the gray water heaved slowly like an immense animal, thewaves starting to curl and then flattening out again as the wind tore at them, beating them down and levelling out even the massive surges of the ocean. Gray sea, gray sky, squalls blotting the horizon, no color in the world at all except when the rollers finally crashed into the striated walls of the cliffs, shattering and sending up great plumes of spray. Godwin had been there so long that he no longer heard the roar of the collision, noticed it only when the spray reached so high up the cliff that the water which soaked his cloak and hood and dripped onto his face turned salt instead of fresh.Not that it made any difference, he thought numbly. It was all just as cold. He could go back into the shelter, kick the slaves aside, warm his frozen hands and feet by the fire. There was no chance of raiders on a day like this. The Vikings were seamen, the greatest seamen in the world, or so they said. You didn't have to be a great seaman to know that there was no point in putting out on a day like this. The wind was due east--no, he reflected, due east a point north. Fine for blowing you across from Denmark, but how could you keep a longship from broaching to in this sea? And how could you steer for a safe landing once you arrived? No, no chance at all. He might as well be by the fire.Godwin looked longingly at the shelter with its little trail of smoke instantly whipped away by the wind, but turned his pace and began to shuffle along the palisade again. His lord had trained him well. "Don't think, Godwin," he had said. "Don't think maybe they'll come today and maybe they won't. Don't believe that it's worth keeping a lookout some of the time and it's not worth it the rest. While it's day, you stay on the Head. Look out all the time. Or one day you'll be thinking one thing and some Stein or Olaf'll think another and they'll be ashore and twenty miles inland before we can catch up with them--if we ever do. And that's a hundred lives lost and a hundred pounds in silver and cattle and burnt thatch. And the rents not paid for years after. So watch, Thane, or it's your estates that will suffer."So his lord Ella had said. And behind him the black crow,Erkenbert, had crouched over his parchment, his quill squeaking as he traced out the mysterious black lines that Godwin feared more than he feared the Vikings. "Two months' service on Flamborough Head to Godwin the thane," he had pronounced. "He is to watch till the third Sunday after <i>Ramis Palmarum.</i>" The alien syllables had nailed the orders down.Watch they had said and watch he would. But he didn't have to do it as dry as a reluctant virgin. Godwin bellowed downwind to the slaves, for the hot spiced ale he had commanded half an hour before. Instantly one of them came running out, the leather mug in his hand. Godwin eyed him with deep disfavor as he trotted over to the palisade and up the ladder to the watchkeeper's walkway. A damned fool, this one. Godwin kept him because he had sharp eyes, but that was all. Merla, his name. He had been a fisherman once. Then there had been a hard winter, little to catch, he had fallen behind with the dues he owed to his landlords, the black monks of St. John's Minister at Beverley, twenty miles off. First he had sold his boat to pay his dues and feed his wife and bairns. Then, when he had no money and could not feed them any longer, he had had to sell his family to a richer man, and in the end had sold himself to his former landlords. And they had lent Merla to Godwin. Damned fool. If the slave had been a man of honor he would have sold himself first and given the money to his wife's kin, so at least they would have taken her in. If he had been a man of sense he would have sold his wife and the bairns first and kept the boat. Then maybe he would have had a chance to buy them back. But he was a man of neither sense nor honor. Godwin turned his back on the wind and the sea and took a firm swallow from the brimming mug. At least the slave hadn't been sipping from it. He could learn from a thrashing if from nothing else.Now what was the wittol staring at? Staring past his master's shoulder, mouth agape, pointing out to sea."Ships," he yelled. "Viking ships, two mile out to sea. I see 'em again. Look, master, look!"Godwin spun automatically, cursed as the hot liquid slopped over his sleeve, peered out into the cloud and rain along the pointing arm. Was there a dot there, out where the cloud met the waves? No, nothing. Or ... maybe. He could see nothing steadily, but out there the waves would be running twenty feet high, high enough to shelter any ship trying to ride out a storm under bare poles."I see 'em," yelled Merla again. "Two ships, a cable apart.""Longships?""No, master, knorrs."Godwin hurled the mug over his shoulder, seized the slave's thin arm in an iron grasp, and slashed him viciously across the face, forehand, backhand, with a sodden leather gauntlet. Merla gasped and ducked but did not dare to try to shield himself."Talk English, you whore's get. And talk sense.""A knorr, master. It's a merchant ship. Deep-bellied, for cargo." He hesitated, afraid to show further knowledge, afraid to conceal it. "I can recognize 'un by ... by the shape of the prow. They must be Vikings, master. We don't use 'em."Godwin stared out to sea again, anger fading, replaced by a cold, hard feeling at the base of his stomach. Doubt. Dread."Listen, Merla, to me," he whispered. "Be very sure. If those are Vikings must call out the entire coast-watch, every man from here to Bridlington. They are only churls and slaves, when all is said and done. No harm if they are dragged from their greasy wives."But I must do something else. As soon as the watch is called I must also send riders in to the minister at Beverley, to the monks of good St. John--your masters, remember?"He paused to note the terror and the old memories in Merla's eyes."And they will call out the mounted levy, the thanes of Ella. No good keeping them here, where the pirates could feint at Flamborough and then be twenty miles off roundSpurn Head before they could get their horses out of the marsh. So they stay back, so they can ride in any direction once the threat is seen. But if I call them out, and they ride over here in the wind and the rain on a fool's errand ... And especially if some Viking sneaks in through the Humber while their backs are turned ..."Well, it would be bad for me, Merla." His voice sharpened and he lifted the underfed slave off the ground. "But by almighty God in heaven I'll see you regret it till the last day you live. And after the thrashing you get that may not be long."But, Merla, if those are Viking ships out there and you let me <i>not</i> report them--I'll hand you back to the black monks and say I could do nothing with you."Now, what do you say? Viking ships, or no?"The slave stared out again to sea, his face working. He would have been wiser, he thought, to say nothing. What was it to him if the Vikings sacked Flamborough, or Bridlington, or Beverley Minster itself? They could not enslave him any more than he was already. Maybe foreign heathens would be better masters than the people of Christ at home. Too late to think that now. The sky was clearing, momentarily. He could see, even if his weak-eyed landlubber of a master could not. He nodded."Two Viking ships, master. Two mile out to sea. Southeast."Godwin was away, bellowing instructions, calling to his other slaves, shouting for his horse, his horn, his small, reluctant force of conscripted freemen. Merla straightened, walked slowly to the southwest angle of the palisade, looked out thoughtfully and carefully. The weather cleared momentarily, and for a few heartbeats he could see plain. He looked at the run of the waves--the turbid yellow line a hundred yards offshore which marked the long, long expanse of tidal sandbanks which ran the full length of this barest and most harborless, wind- and current-swept stretch of English shore--tossed a handful of moss from the palisadeinto the air and studied the way it flew. Slowly a grim and humorless smile creased his careworn face.Great sailors those Vikings might be. But they were in the wrong place, on a lee shore with a widow-maker blowing. Unless the wind dropped, or their heathen gods from Valhalla could help them, they stood no chance. They would never see Jutland or the Vik again.&nbsp;<br>Two hours later fivescore men stood clustered on the beach south of the Head, at the north end of the long, long, inletless stretch of coast that ran down to Spurn Head and the mouth of the Humber. They were armed: leather jackets and caps, spears, wooden shields, a scattering of the broadaxes they used to shape their boats and houses. Here and there a sax, the short chopping sword from which the Saxons to the south took their name. Only Godwin had a metal helmet and mail-shirt to pull on, a brass-hilted broadsword to buckle round his waist. In the normal way of things men like these, the coast-watch of Bridlington, would not hope or expect to stand on the shore and trade blows with the professional warriors of Denmark and Norway. Rather, they would fade away, taking as much as they could of their goods and wives with them. Waiting for the mounted levy, the thane-service of Northumbria, to come down and do the fighting for which they earned their estates and manor houses. Waiting hopefully for a chance to swarm forward and join in the harassing of a beaten enemy, the chance of taking loot. It was not a chance which had come to any Englishman since Oakley fourteen years before. And that had been in the south, in the foreign kingdom of Wessex, where all manner of strange things happened.Nevertheless the mood of the men watching the knorrs out in the bay was unalarmed, even cheerful. Almost every man in the coast-watch was a fisherman, skilled in the ways of the North Sea. The worst water in the world, with its fogs and gales, its monstrous tides and unexpected currents. As the day strengthened and the Viking ships were blown remorselessly closer in, Merla's realization had come to everyone :The Vikings were doomed. It was just a matter of what they could try next. And whether they would try it, lose, and get the wreck over with before the mounted levy Godwin had summoned hours before could arrive, resplendent in its armor, colored cloaks and gold-mounted swords. After which, opinion among the fishermen felt, the chances of any worthwhile plunder for them were low. Unless they marked the spot and tried later, in secret, with grappling irons ... Quiet conversations ran among the men at the rear, with an occasional low laugh."See," the town reeve was explaining to Godwin at the front, "the wind's east a point north. If they put up a scrap of sail they can run west, north or south." He drew briefly in the wet sand at their feet. "If he goes west he hits us. If he goes north he hits the Head. Mind you, if he could get past the Head he'd have a clear run northwest away up to Cleveland. That's why he was trying his sweeps an hour ago. A few hundred yards out to sea and he'd have been free. But what we knows, and what they doesn't, is there's a current. Hell of a current, rips down past the Head. They might as well stir the water with their ..." He paused, not sure how far informality could go."Why doesn't he go south?" cut in Godwin."He will. He's tried the sweeps, tried the sea-anchor to check his drift. It's my guess the one in charge, the <i>jarl</i> what they call them, he knows his men are exhausted. A rare old night they must have had of it. And a shock in the morning when they saw where they were." The reeve shook his head with a kind of professional sympathy."They are not such great sailors," pronounced Godwin with satisfaction. "And God is against them, foul, heathen Church-defilers."A stir of excitement behind them cut off the reply the reeve might have been incautious enough to make. The two men turned.On the path that ran along behind high-water mark, a dozen men were dismounting. The levy? thought Godwin. The thanes from Beverley? No, they could not possiblyhave arrived in this time. They must only now be saddling up. Yet the man in front was a nobleman. Big, burly, fair hair, bright blue eyes, with the upright stance of a man who had never had to plough or hoe for a living. Gold shone beneath his expensive scarlet cape, on buckles and sword-pommel. Behind him strode a smaller, younger version of himself, surely his son. And on the other side of him another youth, tall, straight-backed like a warrior. But dark in complexion, poorly dressed in tunic and wool breeches. Grooms held the horses for half a dozen more armed, competent-looking men--a retinue, surely, a rich thane's hearth-troop.The leading stranger held his empty hand up. "You do not know me," he said. "I am Wulfgar. I am a thane from King Edmund's country, from the East Angles."A stir of interest from the crowd, the dawnings his message might be of hostility."You wonder what I am doing here. I will tell you." He gestured out at the shore. "I hate Vikings. I know more of them than most men. And, like most men, to my sorrow. In my own country, among the North-folk beyond the Wash, I am the coast-guard, set by King Edmund. But long ago I saw that we would never get rid of these vermin while we English fought only our own battles. I persuaded my king of this, and he sent messages to yours. They agreed that I should come north, to talk with the wise men in Beverley and in Eoforwich about what we might do. I took a wrong road last night, met your messengers riding to Beverley this morning. I have come to help." He paused. "Have I your leave?"Godwin nodded slowly. Never mind what the lowborn fish-churl of a reeve said. Some of the bastards might come ashore. And if they did, this lot might well scatter. A dozen armed men just might be useful."Come and welcome," he said.Wulfgar nodded with deliberate satisfaction. "I am only just in time," he remarked.Ou...</p><h2>Conquering Concussion</h2><p>"This lively, well-researched, and hopeful book is an excellent primer for anyone dealing with TBI and its aftermath, from victims to caretakers. It is clearly written and illustrated for the average reader, but contains information that may be new to many healthcare professionals puzzled by odd and unresponsive symptoms and the realization that time alone does not heal the brain. Conquering Concussion by Mary Lee Esty, Ph.D., and C. M. Shifflett presents history, new research, treatments, and 20 years of clinical case histories. These are real stories about real people struggling with post-concussion symptoms: terrible fatigue, headache and body pain, emotional swings, mental fog, insomnia, weight gain and balance problems. It shows how TBI symptoms overlap with other diagnoses such as ADHD and depression, and reveals the link with PTSD. It features neurotherapy, but presents additional therapies that can aid recovery. Topics include:&nbsp; Head injuries in history, from Henry VIII to Elvis Presley. What happens in concussion, the many symptoms that may appear, and problems with standard testing and treatments. The origins, supporting research, and results of neurofeedback. Detailed case histories of children, adults, and soldiers with memory problems, severe head pain, insomnia, ADHD and PTSD. Medical issues which may need attention before symptoms of concussion can heal.&nbsp; The rest of the story: What happened to people in this book who never expected to work or function normally ever again.

The text is written clearly enough to engage lay readers while still providing the thoroughness and documentation demanded by professionals. They cite more than 300 references, mainly scientific journals and academic books, but they also draw from popular media to keep the discussion relevant and down-to-earth.

Most of the artwork is realistic, although the author anthropomorphizes in a few drawings (an ant wearing a hard hat drives a front loader; the ant queen wears a crown and carries a scepter). Overall, the presentation is informative, stimulating, and attractive, with just enough humor to reel in the intended audience.

When in the dawn of June 6, 1944, the western Allies opened their offensive against the Atlantic Wall on the coast of Normandy, with 7,000 ships and 13,000 airplanes, Severloh, the machine-gunner who became the German most feared by the Americans, was posted at Strongpoint WN62. He fired at the G.I.&#39;s on the beach with his machine gun and rifle for nine long hours - more than 2.000 of them were taken down. In a moving and unsparing account, Heinrich Severloh describes the dramatic hours during which 34,000 G.I.&#39;s landed in his sector of what later was called &#34;Bloody Omaha&#34;, and met with the hard-fought resistance of only 300 German soldiers. Severloh the young farmer&#39;s son from the L�neburg heath, survived a firestorm, as bizarre as it was terrible, that stamped the rest of his life.</p><p></p><h2>American Horticultural Society Great Plant Guide</h2><p>Designed to help gardeners choose plants in two different ways, the <i>AHS Great Plant Guide</i> features color photos, A-Z and planting guides, and cold-hardiness and heat-zone maps. Over 1,000 plants have full entries, full-color photographs, and details that tell you what type of plant it is, how it grows, what its ornamental features are, where it grows and looks best, and how to care for it.

A slender beauty with alluring eyes, she built impregnable defenses around her emotions. The men who came to adore her, fought to conquer her and learn her mysteries, made her the toast of London, but none were able to rouse her passions.</p><p></p>Beauty Awakens<p></p><p></p><p>But that hard-taught lesson is about to unravel because of Sir James Stoker. Back in England with a treasure of gold from his adventures, newly knighted by Queen Victoria herself, and feted everywhere, the handsome explorer has the world at his feet. He's exactly the man Coco might have dreamed about when she was young: a tall, fair hero with a charming smile. Now he's turned his energy toward winning her, the most desirable and the least attainable woman he knows; and Coco's aft-aid James may just find his way past the thorns that have so long protected her from the world, and awaken her slumbering heart...with just one kiss.</p></p><p><p>Judith Ivory's work has won many honors, including the Romance Writers of America's RITA and Top Ten Favorite Books of the Year awards and <em>Romantic Times</em> Reviewers' Choice Award. </p>Following his spectacular African expedition, Sir James Stoker has become the darling of high society. At last, this coachman's son achieves fame, fortune and the Order of the Bath from Queen Victoria. And he is about to throw it all away with his obsession for an infamous Parisian courtesan. At 37, Coco Wild is eight years his senior and jaded in matters of love. She is flattered by James's youthful charm and gallantry, and though tempted, she rejects him. After repeated chance encounters, James breaks through her defenses to become her lover. Now, their association threatens his reputation, his chances for a formal title, his friendship with his mentor (the father of Coco's child!) and even his life. From Victorian England to Italy and Monaco, this fair hero plots his seduction of a mysterious beauty amid threats of greed, betrayal, treachery and political machinations. Ivory (Beast) enchants her readers with intense sexual tension, understated but powerful symbolism, great plotting and sympathetic characters who buck tired types. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Night Without End</h2><p>Snow-White...

One of the most improbable stories in the �NFL&#x2014;�my �story&#x2014;�goes back to April 22&#x2013;23, 1990, the weekend of the NFL draft that year: two days of hell for me and my family. My beautiful mother, Rosemarie, invited the whole world to our little house in Kenilworth, New Jersey, to watch the draft.<br><br>And watch. And watch. And watch.<br><br>All twelve rounds of it. Minute after minute, my mom, my brothers Pete and Elio, and my �then-�girlfriend and �now-�wife Kathy (she&#x2019;s been with me since high school) were watching as player after player got picked. Twelve rounds and 331 players, including seven of my teammates from the University of Pittsburgh who were selected. But not me. These days, the NFL has only seven rounds for the draft, and it&#x2019;s a struggle to make the league if you&#x2019;re undrafted. These days you might have two guys on the �fifty-�three-�man roster each year who were undrafted. So think about it: back when I was coming out of Pitt, the league was taking like five rounds of guys who today would have a hard time getting �drafted&#x2014;�and I still �didn&#x2019;t get taken.<br><br>This was like being the last kid picked on the playground. You know when you divide up teams and that last guy is there and the best guy says, &#x201c;Whatever, we&#x2019;ll take him&#x201d;? �That&#x2019;s what my NFL draft weekend was like for me. I had been here before. Growing up, I was good in football, wrestling, and baseball. I was a good �all-�around athlete. Good, but not great. I �wasn&#x2019;t like The Natural when I was seven years old, like some of these guys. I was always bigger and stronger than most kids, so people thought I was older than I actually was. People would say, &#x201c;Oh, you must be twelve.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m like, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m nine.&#x201d; I also used to hang out with older kids because of my older brother Pete. And I also acted older. I �didn&#x2019;t back down from anybody, even when I got my ass kicked. I&#x2019;d tell off the older kids, maybe flip them off. They&#x2019;d chase me down, they&#x2019;d beat me up, and then I&#x2019;d tell them off again. I was a real �smart-�ass.<br><br>Anyway, when I was twelve, I was playing Little League baseball and they picked the �all-�star team. It came down to the last cut, and I �didn&#x2019;t make it. I was the first alternate or whatever they call it. So I walked home the whole way from the field along the railroad tracks that went by my house, crying my eyes out. I&#x2019;m pissed, I&#x2019;m embarrassed, I&#x2019;m hurt, the whole thing. It was like that spark that we all get in our gut when we think nobody wants us. This burning desire goes off in you. At least it did with me. This was the first kind of defining moment for me. I got home, and we had a little pool in the back, so I washed my face off and then went inside. I never told my mom what happened. Then the coaches called up a few days later and told me, &#x201c;Oh, this kid got hurt, you&#x2019;re in, we need you.&#x201d; I thought to myself, These SOBs �didn&#x2019;t pick me, okay, I&#x2019;ll show them. I knew the other kids weren&#x2019;t as good as me, so I had to go prove it.<br><br>Now, part of my problem up to then was that I was always thinking too much, being too careful. I was actually terrified to swing the bat. I don&#x2019;t �really know why. I �wasn&#x2019;t scared of the ball. I think I was just scared that I �wouldn&#x2019;t be perfect. I �didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint anyone; I thought, Let me just get a walk and I&#x2019;ll be fine. My mother used to yell from the stands all the time, &#x201c;Swing the bat!&#x201d; Well, it turns out �that&#x2019;s probably why I �didn&#x2019;t get picked in the first place, and now I had to show these guys I was actually good enough, that I was actually better than everybody else. So in the second game we played, we had the bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the last inning. The kid who was supposed to bat was having a horrible time. He had some problem, and he was like crying or something, and his mother was coming around going, &#x201c;Honey, is something wrong? Are you okay, sweetie?&#x201d; The problem was, he was kind of a �mama&#x2019;s boy, a pussy. Anyway, the coach looked at me and said, &#x201c;Goose, you&#x2019;re up next.&#x201d; I was like, Holy crap, this is great. I get the helmet, I&#x2019;m looking for my �bat&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m all jacked up. Before, I was a little scared to swing for whatever reason. Now, as I go up to the plate, I&#x2019;m deciding I&#x2019;ll swing as hard as I can at the first pitch: I &#x2019;m going to kill this ball. I get up there, the pitcher winds up, and I just remember how slow he seemed to bring the ball. He threw, and I think I probably closed my eyes and swung.<br><br>It&#x2019;s like this awesome dream. There was this �two-�story building just past the �right-�field fence. It&#x2019;s still there if you drive through town. When we were kids, that building was mythic. My brother&#x2019;s friends used to talk about how nobody could ever hit the ball over that building. It was kind of like in that movie The �Sandlot&#x2014;�how they talk about what it&#x2019;s like to hit the ball into the junkyard in center field. Anyway, as the ball was coming, the moment was like something from a movie for me. �Really, if the pitcher had thrown the ball over the backstop, I would have swung anyway, �that&#x2019;s how determined I was. I swung as hard as I could, and bam! I hit the ball. The ball cleared the building for a grand slam: the ultimate scenario. I remember coming around the bases and everybody was jacked up and excited. All the way around, I&#x2019;m thinking, These assholes �didn&#x2019;t want to pick me. I can remember all the players and the coaches standing there at home plate as I turned third base and headed home. And �that&#x2019;s when I knew I could do this. It&#x2019;s funny to think sometimes, what would have happened if I struck out? Would that one moment have completely changed me? Right then and there, that became the theme for my life. I know I can do this.<br><br>Ten years later, it&#x2019;s all happening again as I wait for a chance to play in the NFL. To add a nice kick in the teeth, add the misery of practically every person in my family and every person in town stopping by at one time or another to look in on �what&#x2019;s going on. After a while, people don&#x2019;t even ask, &#x201c;Did he get drafted yet?&#x201d; They come in, give that little pathetic smile like they don&#x2019;t know what to say, and kind of move on. My mother is making macaroni the whole weekend and putting on a brave face, saying, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about him, he&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d;<br><br>I even get a call from Jimmy Johnson in the middle of the whole thing. Jimmy, who I work with at FOX now, was coaching at Dallas, but I knew him from way before that. Jimmy was coaching at the University of Miami when I was in high school, and he recruited me. �That&#x2019;s a whole &#x2019;nother story I&#x2019;ll get into later. Anyway, he calls me and says, &#x201c;Hey, �what&#x2019;s going �on?&#x201d;&#x2014;�like I somehow have some answer for why I&#x2019;m not getting drafted. I answer, &#x201c;Nothing, �what&#x2019;s going on with you?&#x201d; What am I supposed to say?<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the funny part of that call. The reason Jimmy has called me is that he thinks I called him. As the draft is going on, some of my friends, including this guy Crazy Mike Carisino, start calling the Dallas Cowboys. The only thing is, they call claiming to be me and leave messages saying, &#x201c;Jimmy, this is Tony Siragusa, you need to draft me!&#x201d; Crazy Mike comes over, and I tell him that Johnson called. He tells me what he and the guys did. I&#x2019;m like, what are you doing to me? He says back to me, &#x201c;You should have told him to draft you.&#x201d;<br><br>All the while, my older brother Pete and my younger brother Elio are getting more and more pissed off, but they&#x2019;re not saying a thing. Kathy is there too, but she&#x2019;s not letting it bother her. She&#x2019;s just there to support me, comfort me. Talk about somebody who&#x2019;s devoted. I know plenty of women from being in the league who �wouldn&#x2019;t have stuck around for that. She reminds me of that a lot. She says, &#x201c;I was with you when you had nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Me, of course I&#x2019;m pissed too, but I&#x2019;m taking it all in, internalizing the whole thing. It&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m just in a fog. Just the year before, I had lost my dad to a heart attack. And that was after spending a whole year away from football because of a knee injury. Then I went back to college and got jerked around by my coaches. Now, after all of that crap, one pick after another goes by, one round after another goes by, and I&#x2019;m thinking, They took that freaking guy, are you kidding me? I get so fed up, I go to play golf at one point. Me, Kathy, and my brothers go to Weequahic Park Golf Course in Newark, New Jersey, and hit the ball around. I think I shot the best round of my life, like a 77 or something. I&#x2019;m a wreck out there on the course, but I&#x2019;m sinking putt after putt after putt. It was unreal.<br><br>Another time we go out in front of the house and play some basketball on the rim my dad put up on one of the trees way back in the day. We like to call the basketball court our &#x201c;office,&#x201d; where we go to work out any problems. Siragusa family basketball isn&#x2019;t exactly artistic stuff, you have to understand. Me and my brothers were all �really good high school wrestlers. I won a state title, Elio finished second, and Pete was actually probably the best of the three of us. Our game is no blood, no foul. We have a little tradition that we play when things are a little tense. This is a good day for that. We also played before all our weddings. Somebody usually ends up getting a bloody nose. It&#x2019;s a mess.<br><br>After the draft was over, Pete brought me out to the garage and wanted me to start working out with the weights right then and there. He cleared out the whole garage and starts saying, &#x201c;You gotta get ready, you gotta get ready to kill somebody when you get out there.&#x201d; He was so angry because, for him, what I was doing was partly his dream too. My uncle Marty, my mom&#x2019;s brother, was like that too. Half the town was like that. They were so pissed off, it was like it almost happened to them. They felt like they were getting slapped in the face after all their hard work to support me along the way. I felt that from them, and it was a good thing. It was pure support, pure love from people who �really care about you and want to see you succeed.<br><br>The thing is that, as the draft unraveled, I was not letting anybody see me lose control. I �wasn&#x2019;t embarrassed, I was shocked. And then that spark started up again. I remember thinking at one point, What am I going to do now, work construction? I had a million scenarios playing out in my head. I used to work for another one of my uncles in construction, which I �didn&#x2019;t want to do, and he made sure to discourage me as much as possible. He would make me carry cinder blocks all day long and do other kinds of crazy shit just to discourage me from wanting to do that crap. Trust me, he got the message across. One thing was for �certain&#x2014;�I �wasn&#x2019;t going to do that, at least not on those terms. If you want me to do something fun like build a man cave or open a restaurant, I&#x2019;m all over it. But being a pack mule hauling cinder blocks? Oh, hell no.<br><br>Really, I felt more like I somehow let down everybody in my family and my �neighborhood&#x2014;�all the people who helped me out. With me, family is the most important thing, and this hurt. The other part of me was also feeling that much stronger because I know this is the kind of support I have. I know who&#x2019;s �really behind me. I&#x2019;ve known that my whole life. I&#x2019;m going to get into my hometown in the next chapter, but let me just say here, �that&#x2019;s where my real strength comes from. Yeah, I&#x2019;m �six-�foot-�three, �three-�hundred-�something pounds, and all that, but there&#x2019;s plenty of big guys in the NFL. The difference is not how big and strong you are, it&#x2019;s �what&#x2019;s behind you. It&#x2019;s your foundation. My foundation is �rock-�solid: from my mom and late father, to my brothers, to everybody around me.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why, even on one of my worst days, I �didn&#x2019;t lose sight of making it. This is when I&#x2019;m at my best. I love it. I thrive on it. If you want to get me fired up, don&#x2019;t pick me. Let me be the last kid picked. Bet against �me&#x2014;�it&#x2019;ll be the worst decision you ever made. It&#x2019;s like I need somebody to bet against me. If everybody bets on my side, it&#x2019;s a lot harder for me to concentrate. But when I&#x2019;m the underdog, watch out. It&#x2019;s like when I play golf and I&#x2019;m in a foursome where the other three guys are scratch golfers. I&#x2019;ll stay right with them, shot for shot. Then, when my team needs a big drive at the end, I&#x2019;m the guy who will make it happen. Maybe all the other guys hit their shots in the woods, but I&#x2019;ll come through with the shot right in the middle of the fairway.</p><h2>Complete Short Fiction (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The complete short stories of the masterful Irish writer</b><br><br>Fairy tales, ghost stories, detective fiction and comedies of manners&#x2014;the stories collected in this volume made Oscar Wilde's name as a writer of fiction, showing breathtaking dexterity in a wide range of literary styles.

Published on the occasion of an exhibition at National Gallery Singapore, this catalogue features over a hundred full-colour image plates of their works: from sweeping Orientalist hunting scenes to gritty Realist portrayals of the working class. Essays and biographical timelines examine each artist&#x2019;s practices, as well as frame them within the cultural and social dynamics of the 19th century.</p></p><p></p><h2>God the Mother: And Other Theological Essays</h2><p>God the Mother: And Other Theological Essays</p><p></p><h2>Hit and Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber took Sony for a ride in Hollywood</h2><p><i>Hit and Run</i> tells the improbable and often hilarious story of how two film packagers well known for spending other people's money and ripping off credit for other people's work went on a deliberate campaign to reinvent themselves as studio executives. With the exception of <i>Batman</i>, Jon Peters and Peter Guber were barely involved with the most successful films they "produced." Steven Spielberg wouldn't allow them on the set of <i>The Color Purple</i>, and they werre on the set of <i>Rain Man</i> only once, briefly. With the help of one of Michael Milken's top lieutenants, they succeeded. It was the most audacious sales job of their careers: This unlikely team got Sony to give them the richest deal in Hollywood history.</p><p>If there is a more archetypical tale of Hollywood in the &#39;80s than the buccaneers&#39; adventures of Jon Peters, Barbra Streisand&#39;s former hairdresser, and his business partner Peter Guber, it hasn&#39;t been written yet. This thorough, stylish book recounts the rise of Peters and Guber, who together earned fortunes by schmoozing their way to the top, seducing gullible investors, and shoving aside the filmmakers who actually turned out successful films like &#34;Rain Man&#34; and &#34;Batman.&#34; The Japanese executives at Sony, in this delightful insider account, were just the most recent and most hoodwinked in a long line of Peters&#39; and Gubers&#39; dupes.Nancy Griffin Nancy Griffin is the Deputy Editor of <i>Premiere</i> and lives in New York and Los Angeles. <p> <b>Photo:</b> Douglas Kirkland</p></p><h2>Glyph: A Novel</h2><p>With this wildly inventive new novel, Percival Everett has created his unlikeliest hero to date. Mute by choice, and able to read complex philosophical treatises and compose passable short stories while still in the crib, baby Ralph does not consider himself a genius-- because he is unable to drive. Plenty of others, however, want a stake in this precocious child prodigy. Among the most fiendish are Dr. Steimmel, the psychiatrist to whom his bewildered parents first take him, and her assistant Boris; Dr. Davis and her illegal chimps; and not-so-sweet Nanna, the secret agent. All have plans for Ralph, and no one wants to share the poor infant who misses his mother and does not take kindly to his new role as "Defense Stealth Operative." Throughout the ensuing nation-wide chase of which he is the center, Ralph ponders on the theories of literary form-- and comes to some surprising conclusions of his own that perhaps only a baby could dream up.<br><br>A narrative to question narrative, a highly original analysis of analysis, Everett's tour de farce prompts one to acknowledge that his is the true genius.<br></p><p>Praise for <i>Glyph</i><br><br>Carol Muske-Dukes "<i>Glyph</i> is an answer-- and an antidote-- to not only what ails the Academy, but what ails a society without the self-knowledge to satirize itself. Percival Everett's infant genius protagonist vaults out of the playpen like Voltaire in flaming diapers-- to dispatch Theory's charlatans, kidnappers and con men in this brilliantly, wildly parodic romp. Deconstruct THIS!!!"<br><br>Terry McMillan "I think Percival Everett is a genius. I've been a fan since his first novel. He continues to amaze me with each novel-- as if he likes making 90 degree turns to see what's around the corner, and then over the edge. I think he has a following, but not large enough. He's a brilliant writer and so damn smart I envy him."<br><b>Percival Everett</b> is the author of 12 other books, including <i>Watershed</i>, <i>Frenzy</i>, and<i> Big Picture</i>.

The pages are enriched by family photos; dining passages from stories such as <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>; his short stories; personal correspondence; and even a contribution from his last wife, Mary. Collecting recipes from former Hemingway haunts, period cookbooks, and other sources, this book is an authentic re-creation of the meals that so enriched Hemingway&#x2019;s literature.</p><p>On the 100th anniversary of Ernest Hemingway's birth, Craig Boreth gives the reader a tour of the author's taste buds in <i>The Hemingway Cookbook</i>. With chapters titled "The Early Years," "Italy," "France," "Spain," "Key West and Cuba," "East Africa," and "Idaho," as well as the Hemingway Wine Cellar and the Hemingway Bar, the reader is assured of finding taste treats ranging from fried trout to fried gudgeon, from pork and beans and spaghetti to eland piccata. And everywhere in between are countless photos of Hemingway with and without beard, as well as with and without clothes. <p> Boreth's contribution to Hemingwayiana is in providing the connective tissue among all the various stations of the author's life, collecting all possible references to food and drink, and then ferreting out suitable recipes to evoke a similar pleasure. For example, in the 1920s Hemingway writes about a lunch with John dos Passos ("whom I consider a very forceful writer, and an exceedingly pleasant fellow besides"). The meal included Rollmops (a herring dish), Sole Meuni�re, Civet de Li�vre � la Cocotte (jugged hare), and Marmelade des Pommes. Boreth provides the recipes. The reader is left to wonder what the Montrachet 1919, the Hospice de Beaune 1919, and the bottle of Chambertin might have been like. </p><p> <i>The Hemingway Cookbook</i> reads like an anthology of postcards sent back from the author's life. The collected recipes are eccentric, as any collection connected to any individual could not help but be. It's like being handed a metal box stuffed with 3-by-5 recipe cards, all of them written in Hemingway's hand and gathered from one end of his life to the other. A curiosity, really. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><b>Craig Boreth</b> is the author of <i>How to Iron Your Own Damn Shirt</i> and <i>How to Feel Manly in a Minivan</i> and the owner of&nbsp;the Santa Monica Chocolate Company.</p><h2>A Vision for Venture Capital: Realizing the Promise of Global Venture Capital and Private Equity</h2><p>A Vision for Venture Capital chronicles a distinguished career on the frontiers of international finance during the past half-century. Peter Brooke has been called &#34;the Johnny Appleseed of venture capital&#34; for his role in the industry&#39;s spectacular growth-- from a small base in the Northeastern United States in the 1960s, to today&#39;s highly visible role in economies all over the world. The key to Brooke&#39;s success--and his lasting legacy--is his vision for the industry as an essential element of economic growth and development. At a time when some believe that venture capital&#39;s best days are behind it, and private equity has come under harsh criticism in the United States and elsewhere, A Vision for Venture Capital offers a fresh look at why the industry exists and how it can fulfill its potential in the twenty-first century.</p><p>PETER A.

Stalin&#39;s ultimatum, demanding the cession of huge tracts of territory as a buffer zone against Nazi Germany, had been rejected by the Finnish government, and now a small Baltic republic was at war with the giant Soviet military machine. But this forgotten war, fought under brutal, sub-arctic conditions, often with great heroism on both sides, proved one of the most astonishing in military history. Using guerrilla fighters on skis, even reindeer to haul supplies on sleds, heroic single-handed attacks on tanks, and with unfathomable endurance and the charismatic leadership of one of the 20th century&#39;s true military geniuses, Finland not only kept at bay but won an epic, if short-lived, victory over the hapless Russian conscripts. Its surreal engagements included the legendary &#34;Sausage Battle&#34;, when starving Soviet troops who had over-run a Finnish encampment couldn&#39;t resist the cauldrons of hot sausage soup left behind by their opponents - and were ambushed as they stopped to sup. Although by sheer attritional weight of numbers Stalin eventually prevailed over the Finns, their pointed resistance enabled their country to remain free, even as other countries fell one by one.</p><p></p><h2>Tragedy at Two (Lois Meade Mystery)</h2><p>She&#39;s worked through all the days of the week, scrubbing up both messes and murderers in the village of Long Farnden.

Lois Meade looked across at her husband, Derek, and her mother, both sound asleep in the sitting room, in spite of the television. She smiled and got silently to her feet. She would take just a few steps. . . . She swayed to the beat, and her feet began to move.</p><p>Derek and Gran slept on. Lois lifted her arms and began to circle the furniture. She hummed the tune, now wilder and faster. There was excitement and danger in it, and the promise of something wonderfully triumphant. As she twirled around the sofa, she had her eyes shut in imagined ecstasy. And so tripped over Derek&#x2019;s feet.</p><p>&#x201c;You all right, gel?&#x201d; he said, rubbing his eyes. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want that ruddy noise, do we,&#x201d; he said, and pressed the off button.</p><p>LOIS MEADE WAS A SENSIBLE MOTHER OF TWO GROWN-UP SONS and one daughter, and lived in Long Farnden, a small village in the heart of England. She had been born in the nearby town of Tresham, married Derek, an electrician, and having left school as soon as possible with zero qualifications, she had become a cleaner, choosing jobs outside town, in the villages around.</p><p>Lois was ambitious, provided there was no studying involved, and she and Derek scraped up enough money for the mortgage on a solid, substantial house that had belonged to one of her clients in Long Farnden. Here she set up a cleaning business, wittily named New Brooms. &#x201c;We Sweep Cleaner&#x201d; was the motto emblazoned on her white van. The business had taken off, and though Lois continued to have weekly staff meetings in her office at home, she was soon able to rent a main office in Tresham.</p><p>All very praiseworthy and straightforward. But Lois had been a rebel in her youth, and had even spent a night in a police station cell for refusing to give her correct name and details when she and her gang had been picked up for disorderly behaviour. She had quite cheerfully admitted that she carried a knife for self-protection in a school that had a reputation for being rough.</p><p>Now a law-abiding wife and mother, she still sometimes had a rebellious itch, needing the excitement that came from sailing close to the wind. For a few years now, she had been involved in gathering information helpful to the law.</p><p>In other words, she was an informer, working with the police. But not quite that, she would be at pains to point out. An amateur sleuth would be more accurate. She took no money, worked only on cases that interested her, or&#x2014;as in her last involvement&#x2014;where her own family was in danger. And probably the greatest incentive, she would be loath to admit, was that she worked only with Detective Chief Inspector Hunter Cowgill.</p><p>At the moment, she was having a fallow period. No ferretin&#x2019;, as Derek called it. She had only the efficient organising of her business to think about. Her team of cleaners, including one young man who also took on interior d�cor commissions, was handpicked and knew their jobs inside out. All gathered at a meeting once a week at Lois&#x2019;s house, and Hazel, one of the longest serving, manned the office in Tresham.</p><p>&#x201c;I was enjoying that,&#x201d; Lois said now, frowning at Derek. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me gypsy blood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What gypsy blood?&#x201d; Gran said sharply. She had an uncanny knack of being able to listen when apparently asleep. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no tinkers in our family!&#x201d;</p><p>Derek laughed. &#x201c;What about Lois&#x2019;s dad?&#x201d; he teased. &#x201c;He had dark skin and that nose he&#x2019;s passed on to our Douglas. Definitely a gyppo&#x2019;s nose, that.&#x201d; He got to his feet and went over to help Gran to her feet. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;time we all went to bye-byes.&#x201d;</p><p>Lois sniffed. &#x201c;Time you stopped saying that,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;We got no children now, don&#x2019;t forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Gran, &#x201c;but it might not be long.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off,&#x201d; said Lois, but Derek stared at Gran.</p><p>&#x201c;You know something I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Douglas and Susie, o&#x2019; course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Blimey, they&#x2019;re not wed yet. Give &#x2019;em a chance.&#x201d;</p><p>Derek went to the window to draw the curtains back ready for morning. &#x201c;Hey, Lois!&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Come down here. Something&#x2019;s going on outside!&#x201d; He put out the lights, and the three of them stood at the window, peering out. A car had drawn up outside their gate, and the interior light was on. A man was speaking on a mobile phone. Then he began to get out of the car, and Lois caught her breath. As the door opened, she saw who it was.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s him!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What a cheek, at this time of night! It&#x2019;s Hunter Cowgill. Come on, let&#x2019;s creep upstairs and pretend we&#x2019;re asleep. Quick, Gran! He&#x2019;s coming up the drive.&#x201d;</p><p>By the time the soft knocking began at the door, Gran was safely in her room, and Lois sat hand in hand with Derek on the top stair.</p><p>Cowgill did not go away. He knocked louder, and then called through the letter box. &#x201c;Sorry, Lois, but it&#x2019;s urgent. Derek? Could you open up for a minute?&#x201d;</p><p>Lois put her finger to her lips and turned to Derek. He was making a strange face, his eyes half-closed. Then he sneezed, twice, muffled as best he could. Then, after a loud gasp, a final explosion at full volume.</p><p>Lois got wearily to her feet. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fair cop,&#x201d; she said to Cowgill as she opened the door. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better come in.&#x201d;</p><p><b>TWO</b></p><p>DEREK PUT ON THE LIGHTS IN THE SITTING ROOM AND LOOKED at Lois. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you want <i>me</i> here,&#x201d; he said. It was a statement, not a question. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in the kitchen. Shall I put the kettle on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Lois said firmly. &#x201c;This won&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d;</p><p>Cowgill nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be as brief as possible,&#x201d; he said, and waited until Derek had gone out and shut the door behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry about this,&#x201d; he began, but Lois interrupted him.</p><p>&#x201c;Cut the apologies,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What d&#x2019;you want? It had better be important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is. Your daughter Josie&#x2019;s partner has been found badly beaten up in a ditch on the way to Waltonby. He&#x2019;s been taken into Tresham General, and Josie is with him. I promised her I would tell you straightaway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rob? Beaten up? Oh, dear God, no! What on earth was he doing out there at this time of night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seems he could have been there a while. A passing motorist spotted him and alerted us. Are you all right, Lois?&#x201d; he added. She was very pale, and did not look too steady to him. He got up and called through to the kitchen. &#x201c;Derek! I think we need that kettle on after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want Derek in here. Without the tea,&#x201d; said Lois, shaking herself.</p><p>Cowgill went over the facts again, and saw that Lois had taken Derek&#x2019;s hand for reassurance. &#x201c;It is up to you both whether you want to go to the hospital straightaway,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Josie looked shattered, of course. She might be glad of some support.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is his life in danger?&#x201d; Derek asked. Rob was not his favourite person, but he&#x2019;d been Josie&#x2019;s partner for some time and Derek respected that. He had noticed that the relationship had cooled off lately, partly because Cowgill&#x2019;s nephew Matthew Vickers, also a policeman and lately transferred to the Tresham force, had shown considerable interest in Josie. Derek was not blind. He could see the way the wind was blowing.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t tell you how seriously he is hurt, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; Cowgill answered. &#x201c;No doubt Josie has been told.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;ll go in to the General,&#x201d; Lois said. &#x201c;Good job we&#x2019;d only just gone up. Have you any idea who could&#x2019;ve attacked Rob?&#x201d; she asked Cowgill. He shook his head. &#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Rob&#x2019;s a bit of a wimp,&#x201d; said Derek carefully. &#x201c;Not so good at defending himself, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on, Derek,&#x201d; Lois said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get going. Your van or mine?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>JOSIE WAS SITTING IN A HUDDLE BY THE HOSPITAL BED, WHERE Rob lay unmoving, with monitoring equipment pipping away beside him. She looked up as she heard her parents approach, and Lois&#x2019;s heart lurched. &#x201c;Oh, Josie,&#x201d; she whispered, and put her arms around her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, duckie,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;Mum&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Dad,&#x201d; Derek said, putting his hand on Josie&#x2019;s shoulder. A nurse brought up two chairs for them, and they sat down. For some time they sat without speaking, holding hands. Lois had not looked at Rob&#x2019;s face, but now steeled herself and glanced over at the bed. His eyes were swollen and bruised, and the rest of his face was like a piece of raw steak.</p><p>&#x201c;The bastards,&#x201d; Derek whispered. He leaned across to Josie, who was now sitting up straight and staring fixedly at Rob. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, me duck,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>Now the nurse returned and beckoned to Josie, who disappeared with her into the corridor. Lois looked at Derek with raised eyebrows. He shook his head and shrugged. Rob didn&#x2019;t look at all good to him, but with all that bruising and swelling it was difficult to guess how bad he was in himself.</p><p>Josie reappeared and sat down again. She looked at Lois and her chin quivered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a chance,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all they can say at the moment.&#x201d; Then a tear ran down her cheek unchecked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all my fault,&#x201d; she blurted out, and the dam burst.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>IT WAS GETTING LIGHT BY THE TIME LOIS AND DEREK LEFT THE hospital. Lois had not wanted to go, but the nurse had assured her they would look after Josie. She had said there was no point in them losing sleep when they had to work the next day. &#x201c;Or I should say today,&#x201d; she said with a smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be able to get three or four hours in if you go straightaway,&#x201d; she had said firmly, and now they were on the way back to Long Farnden.</p><p>&#x201c;What did she mean, it was all her fault?&#x201d; Lois asked.</p><p>Derek shook his head. &#x201c;Search me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The only thing I can think is that they had a row and Rob stormed out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And got into a punch-up with a gang for no reason at all? Not very likely, is it? As you so tactfully put it, Rob is a bit of a wimp. He&#x2019;s a mild chap and wouldn&#x2019;t pick a quarrel with anybody, let alone a marauding gang.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could&#x2019;ve been just one drunk on his way home. Big bloke, took offence at nothing, like they do. Rob didn&#x2019;t stand a chance. That&#x2019;s my best guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Lois opened the door wearily and found Gran in her dressing gown sitting at the kitchen table, head on her hands, fast asleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Sshh!&#x201d; Lois whispered to Derek, but Gran was waking up.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are, then,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Tell me the worst.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All I&#x2019;m telling you at the moment is that Rob&#x2019;s got a good chance, and is in good hands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God.&#x201d; Gran struggled to her feet and reached automatically for the kettle. &#x201c;You two get off up to bed and I&#x2019;ll bring you a cup of that calming rubbish Josie sells in the shop. She swears by it, but I bet it&#x2019;d take more than tea that smells of cats&#x2019; pee to calm her right now.&#x201d;</p><p>But by the time Gran had boiled the kettle on the Rayburn and taken up the tea, Lois and Derek were asleep, arms around each other.

Television was being advertised for the first time to American consumers. Europe was on the brink of war as Hitler and Mussolini signed an alliance in Berlin. These were the days before sonar and before the discovery of nuclear power revolutionized submarine design. Dependent on battery power, submarines were actually surface ships that "occasionally dipped beneath the waves." If a sub went down, "every man on board was doomed. It was accepted that there would be no deliverance." <p>Swede Momsen was, according to master storyteller Peter Maas, the "greatest submariner the Navy ever had," and he was determined to beat those odds. Momsen spent his career trying to save the lives of trapped submariners, despite an indifferent Navy bureaucracy that thwarted and belittled his efforts at every turn. Every way of saving a sailor entombed in a sub--"smoke bombs, telephone marker buoys, new deep-sea diving techniques, escape hatches, artificial lungs, a great pear-shaped rescue chamber--was either a direct result of Momsen's inventive derring-do, or of value only because of it." Yet on the day the Squalus sank, none of Momsen's inventions had been used in an actual submarine disaster. </p><p> In <i>The Terrible Hours</i>, Maas reconstructs the harrowing 39 hours between the disappearance of the submarine Squalus during a test dive off the New England coast and the eventual rescue of 33 crew members trapped in the vessel 250 feet beneath the sea. It's also the story of Momsen's triumph. Under the worst possible circumstances, Momsen led a successful mission and helped change the future of undersea lifesaving. Not only has Maas written a carefully researched and suspenseful tribute to a true hero, in the process he has salvaged a long-forgotten, riveting piece of American history. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>7 cds</p><h2>Fathers and Sons: The Autobiography of a Family</h2><p><p>If there is a literary gene, then the Waugh family most certainly has it&#x2014;and it clearly seems to be passed down from father to son. The first of the literary Waughs was Arthur, who, when he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry at Oxford in 1888, broke with the family tradition of medicine. He went on to become a distinguished publisher and an immensely influential book columnist. He fathered two sons, Alec and Evelyn, both of whom were to become novelists of note (and whom Arthur, somewhat uneasily, would himself publish); both of whom were to rebel in their own ways against his bedrock Victorianism; and one of whom, Evelyn, was to write a series of immortal novels that will be prized as long as elegance and lethal wit are admired. Evelyn begat, among seven others, Auberon Waugh, who would carry on in the family tradition of literary skill and eccentricity, becoming one of England&#x2019;s most incorrigibly cantankerous and provocative newspaper columnists, loved and loathed in equal measure. And Auberon begat Alexander, yet another writer in the family, to whom it has fallen to tell this extraordinary tale of four generations of scribbling male Waughs.<br><br>The result of his labors is <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, one of the most unusual works of biographical memoir ever written. In this remarkable history of father-son relationships in his family, Alexander Waugh exposes the fraught dynamics of love and strife that has produced a succession of successful authors. Based on the recollections of his father and on a mine of hitherto unseen documents relating to his grandfather, Evelyn, the book skillfully traces the threads that have linked father to son across a century of war, conflict, turmoil and change. It is at once very, very funny, fearlessly candid and exceptionally moving&#x2014;a supremely entertaining book that will speak to all fathers and sons, as well as the women who love them.</p></p><p><p>ALEXANDER WAUGH is the grandson of Evelyn Waugh and the son of columnist Auberon Waugh and novelist Teresa Waugh. He has been the opera critic at the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> and the <i>Evening Standard</i> and has written several books on music, as well as <i>Time</i> (1999) and <i>God</i> (2002). He is at work on a book about the Wittgenstein family centering on Paul, the world-famous one-handed pianist. He lives in Somerset, England, with his wife, two daughters and one son, Bron.</p><b>I<br>Pale Shadows</b><br><br>I shall begin with a telephone call. It was half past seven on the morning of 17 January 2001 &#x2014; <i>annus horribilis</i> &#x2014; when I was woken by the ringing.<br><br>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x2019; my mother said.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be right over.&#x2019;<br><br>Quivering with excitement I told Eliza to break it to our children and to ring her father who, as planned, would act as conveyor of this dread information to the press.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later I was at Combe Florey, turning under the Elizabethan archway, looking up at my father&#x2019;s house. Unless I am very much mistaken, it was sulking. A gaping ambulance was parked by the perron. My elder sister was waiting for me by the front door. In the kitchen I was greeted by my mother and two sheepish paramedics. All three were ashen. Then the telephone rang &#x2014; already, the first shoot of my father-in-law&#x2019;s grapevine: reporters from the Press Association seeking verification and a quotation.<br><br>My mother answered: &#x2018;It is hard to sum up someone so wonderful,&#x2019; I heard her telling them, &#x2018;but I&#x2019;ve been hanging around for forty years, so that says something.&#x2019; <br><br>I slunk out of the kitchen and shimmied up the stairs.<br><br>In his room the curtains were drawn, but there was just enough light to acknowledge the effect: open mouth, closed eyes; face a tobacco-stain yellow. The spectacle was disconcerting but, for the first time at least, I understood what &#x2018;He&#x2019;s dead&#x2019; really meant. I sat on the armchair facing his bed and, for a short while, thought about death, endings, termini . . . There was no communication between us, not even in my imagination, and after a couple of minutes the stillness of the room began to oppress me. Now what? I wondered. A prayer? Should I speak to the corpse? Am I supposed to touch it? (1)<br><br>&#x2018;No. That is not Papa, just a gruesome remnant.&#x2019; I slunk back down the stairs to the kitchen, glad, at least, that I&#x2019;d seen it.<br>The night before was the last time we had talked together. There was a brief exchange, until he lost consciousness. <br><br>&#x2018;Ah, a little bird has come to see me. How delightful!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, Papa it&#x2019;s me. I suppose you must have thought I was a bird because I was whistling as I came up the stairs.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a bit more complicated than that,&#x2019; he replied, with a hint of the old twinkle.<br><br>I could not be surprised that the last words he spoke to me were intended as a joke: he was always funny, but those drawn-out deathbed days were &#x2014; despite our finest efforts &#x2014; not particularly amusing. It is not true that the dying are more honest than the living &#x2014; I agree with Nietzsche about that: &#x2018;Almost everyone is tempted by the solemn bearing of the bystanders, the streams of tears, the feelings held back or let flow, into a now conscious, now unconscious comedy of vanity.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Everything is going to be dandy,&#x2019; Papa had insisted, as he lay uncomfortable and bemused with the skids well underneath him.&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t life grand?&#x2019;<br><br>On the next day the papers were full of it: &#x2018;Waugh, scourge of pomposity, dies in his sleep,&#x2019; trumpeted <i>The Times</i>; &#x2018;End of Bron&#x2019;s Age&#x2019; was the Express&#x2019;s more comic effort. His death was lamented by the Australians on the front of their <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, by the Americans with long obituaries in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> (&#x2018;Auberon Waugh, witty mischief maker, is dead&#x2019;), and as far afield as Singapore, India and Kenya. At home, all of Fleet Street rallied. Even the tabloid <i>Sun</i>, victim of his mockery for over three decades, sounded a plucky Last Post. Here is a typical broadside from earlier days:<br><br>The <i>Sun&#x2019;s</i> motives in whipping up hatred against an imaginary &#x2018;elite&#x2019; of educated cultivated people are clear enough: &#x2018;Up your Arias!&#x2019; it shouted on Saturday in its diatribe against funding which put &#x2018;rich bums on opera-house seats.&#x2019; If ever the <i>Sun&#x2019;s</i> readers lift their snouts from their newspaper&#x2019;s hideous, half-naked women to glimpse the sublime through music, opera, the pictorial and plastic arts or literature, then they will never look at the <i>Sun</i> again. It is the <i>Sun&#x2019;s</i> function to keep its readers ignorant and smug in their own unpleasant, hypocritical, proletarian culture.<br><br>Undeterred, Britain&#x2019;s best-selling tabloid gallantly mourned his passing. &#x2018;Good Man&#x2019; was the heading in its leader column that day:<br><br><i>Auberon Waugh, who has died at the age of 61, was a writer and journalist with a unique and wonderful talent.</i><br><br>True he occasionally used his talent to attack the Sun. But his wit shone like a beacon.We suspect he loved us as much as we loved him.<br><br><i>Our sympathies are with his family. His was a great life lived well.</i><br>If this was remarkable the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, a paper for which he had worked for nearly forty years, elected to treat his death as though it were the outbreak of World War III. A top front-page news story (&#x2018;Auberon Waugh, Scourge of the Ways of the World, Dies at 61&#x2019;) propelled its readers on a five-page binge-tour of his life and work, complete with portraits, obituaries, quotations, adoring reminiscences and amused commentaries. (2) A.N.Wilson, in a piece entitled &#x2018;Why Genius Is the Only Word to Describe Auberon Waugh&#x2019;, put down a marker for his immortality:<br><br>He will surely be seen as the Dean Swift of our day, in many ways a much more important writer than Evelyn Waugh. Rather than aping his father by writing conventional novels, he made a comic novel out of contemporary existence, and in so doing provided some of the wisest, most hilarious, and &#x2014; it seems an odd thing to say &#x2014; some of the most humane commentary of any contemporary writer on modern experience.<br>I was pleased by these sentiments, even though Wilson&#x2019;s use of the word &#x2018;important&#x2019; spoils the thing a little. My father, who spent his life vigorously lobbing brickbats at the whole muddled notion of &#x2018;importance&#x2019;,would have laughed at the idea of himself as an &#x2018;important&#x2019; writer.<br><br>My various solutions to the problems which beset the nation are intended as suggestions to be thrown around in pubs, clubs and dining rooms. If the Government adopted even a tenth of them, catastrophe would surely result...The essence of journalism is that it should stimulate its readers for a moment, possibly open their minds to some alternative perception of events, and then be thrown away, with all its clever conundrums, its prophecies and comminations, in the great wastepaper basket of history.<br>If journalism was not &#x2018;important&#x2019; to him he nevertheless held it, as a profession, in high regard. It was only when journalists took their jobs too seriously, when they tried to play an active part in shaping events, that he began to lose his enthusiasm for the press. The sole purpose of political journalism, he always insisted, was to deflate politicians, the self-important and the power mad: &#x2018;We should never, never suggest new ways for them to spend money or taxes they could increase, or new laws they could pass. There is nothing so ridiculous as the posture of journalists who see themselves as part of the sane and pragmatic decision-taking process.&#x2019;<br><br>One such figure was Polly Toynbee, a hardened campaigner of the &#x2018;liberal left&#x2019;, whom Papa had long regarded as the preposterous embodiment of all that is most self-important, humourless and wrong-headed within his own profession. She was stung by the glowing obituaries he received and decided, while his body was still awaiting interment on a mortuary slab in Taunton, to launch an impassioned counterblast in the Guardian. The effect of this could not have been more explosive or more satisfactory. Just as I feared the press was about to wander from the subject, as the bleak prospect of a January burial was all that lay ahead by way of comfort to the grieving, a new fire was ignited: Papa was briefly revivified. <br><br>Toynbee&#x2019;s piece cannot be easily summarised because its gist was clouded by too many swipes at her enemies among the living. If her readers were either hoping for or expecting a prize-fight between Ms Toynbee and a dead man they must have been disappointed: all they got was a bewildering m�l�e of emotional ringside scraps What was it all about? Well, at the root of Ms Toynbee&#x2019;s article could be heard a distant wail of indignation, not so much at Auberon Waugh himself as at his influence. This she termed &#x2018;the world of Auberon Waugh&#x2019;, and characterised as &#x2018;a coterie of reactionary fogeys...effete, drunken, snobbish, sneering, racist and sexist&#x2019;. Her article caused a nationwide explosion of support for the deceased. &#x2018;Never,&#x2019; wrote the eminent Keith Waterhouse in his Daily Mail column, &#x2018;never in a lifetime spent in this black trade have I read a nastier valedictory for a fellow scribe.&#x2019; &#x2018;Polly put the kettle on,&#x2019; howled the Telegraph&#x2019;s leader writer, while the New Statesman hit back with: &#x2018;Polly Toynbee is wrong.The writer she reviled as a &#x2018;ghastly man&#x2019; should be celebrated alongside George Lansbury and Fidel Castro as a hero of the left.&#x2019;<br><br>I swung my own fist into the ruckus with a riposte published on the letters page the following day:<br><br>In an earnest piece (Ghastly Man, January 19) Polly Toynbee registered her views on the death of a humorous journalist a few days ago. &#x2018;We might let Auberon Waugh rest in peace,&#x2019; she heaved, &#x2018;were it not for the mighty damage his clan has done to British political life, journalism and discourse in the post war years.&#x2019;<br><br>This was illustrated by a drawing of my father&#x2019;s ...</p><h2>Mackenzies&#39; Honor: An Anthology</h2><p>Mackenzies&#39; Honor by Linda Howard released on Aug 30, 2005 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Linda Howard is the award-winning author of many <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including <em>Up Close and Dangerous, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Cover of Night, Killing Time, To Die For, Kiss Me While I Sleep, Cry No More, </em>and <em>Dying to Please.</em> She lives in Alabama with her husband and two golden retrievers.</p><h2>Contractor&#39;s Guide to Quality Concrete Construction, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Written by and for contractors, this publication provides insight into proven construction practices that will produce quality concrete construction.

In June, 2007, Little Richard's 1955 Specialty Records single, "Tutti Frutti," topped Mojo magazine's list of "100 Records That Changed the World." But back in the early 1950s, nobody gave Little Richard a second glance. It was a time in America where the black and white worlds had co-existed separately for nearly two centuries. After "Tutti Frutti," Little Richard began garnering fans from both sides of the civil rights divide. He brought black and white youngsters together on the dance floor and even helped to transform race relations.<br><i></i><br><i>Little Richard: The Birth of Rock 'n' Roll</i> begins by grounding the reader in the fertile soil from which Little Richard's music sprang. In Macon, Georgia, David Kirby interviews relatives and local characters, who knew Little Richard way back when, citing church and family as his true inspiration. His antics began as early as grade school, performing for his classmates every time the teacher would leave the room, connecting to an age-old American show biz tradition of charade and flummery. On the road, Little Richard faced competition from his peers, honing his stage show and making it, too, an act that could not be counterfeited.</p><p>Kirby sees Little Richard as a foxy warrior, fighting with skill and cunning to take his place among the greats. In the words of Keith Richards (on hearing "Tutti Frutti" for the first time), "it was as though the world changed suddenly from monochrome to Technicolor." Those sentiments have consistently been echoed by the music-listening world, and the time is ripe for a reassessment of Little Richard's genius and legacy.</p></p><p><b>David Kirby</b> is the Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of English at Florida State University and lives in Tallahassee, Florida. Among his thirty books is <i>The House on Boulevard St.: New and Selected Poems</i> (Louisiana State University Press, 2007), which was a finalist for the 2007 National Book Award. He has written on music for<i> The Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>TriQuarterly, The Washington Post, The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Georgia Music</i>, and others. For more information, visit www.davidkirby.com."So much about the 'architect of rock 'n' roll' defies linear logic that his life and work lend themselves to a more digressive and intuitive chronicle. It takes a poet, in other words,to convey the miracle of Little Richard. David Kirby limns his subject with the loop-de-loops of wonder, mischief, and insight that characterize his verse, and the resultingaccount sings in a way that, like the singer's hammy, barn-storming performances, makes you gyrate with pleasure. It is less a straightforward biography than a meditation on art, music, and culture through a lens lined heavily with kohl and 'Pancake 31' makeup. Kirby's hagiography fits his subject like a sequined cape. Its fringe of odd details and learned asides affirms his contention that, 'All new music changes the world, but no music changed the world the way this song did.'"- Candice Dyer, author of "Street Singers, Soul Shakers, and Rebels With a Cause: Music from Macon"<br><br>"In Kirby's book, Elvis and Chuck Berry are milquetoasts next to Little Richard: The former Richard Penniman channeled Baudelaire, hard bop and juke-joint hoodoo, and invented rock &amp; roll in two and a half minutes with 'Tutti Frutti.' The Georgia Peach is well and truly buffed."<br>&#x2014; Rolling Stone<br><br>"In the poem "The House of Blue Light"&#x2014;whose eponym is where Miss Molly does her rockin', dontcha know&#x2014;Kirby says that when he, � la Whitman, hears America singing, it "sounds like Little Richard." He sticks to his line in this high-spirited, ambulatory meditation on Richard's America. Ambulatory literally as Kirby pinballs mostly around Macon, Georgia, Richard's hometown, but also New Orleans, where Richard recorded his first big hit, and L.A., home of Specialty Records, which Richard made a major independent label. Ambulatory spiritually, too, because Kirby adopts Greil Marcus' canny conception of Old, Weird America&#x2014;poor, superstitious, culturally "backward," but always striving&#x2014;as the homeground of rock 'n' roll (along with the other vernacular American pop musics: gospel, blues, country) to explain Richard's artistic roots. Kirby insists that that first big hit, "Tutti Frutti," a cleaned-up "paean to heinie-poking" howled by "a gay black cripple from a town nobody ever heard of," is the first 100-proof rock 'n' roll song and devotes the central chapter here to its creation and impact. Kirby packs his prose as fully as he does his verse and likewise runs it on high octane, pedal to the metal. He beats all the professional rock scribes hollow with this light-footed but profound little book."<br>-Booklist, STARRED Review<br>"David Kirby, a poet and professor in Tallahassee, Florida, is on an uphill, uproarious mission to rewrite the legacy of Macon's outsize Little Richard. "'Tutti Frutti' occupies a finite space smack in the middle of our huge-ass Crab Nebula of a culture," Kirby writes. "It's like the skinniest part of an hourglass; everything that came before flows into this narrow pass, and the world we live in today flows out the other side." Even if you don't agree with the sentiment, you have to admire Kirby's enthusiasm. This is a very personal biography, full of good-humored energy and insightful wit."<br>-Theresa Weaver, Atlanta Magazine<br>"Kirby isn't interested in stolidly documenting all of Little Richard's life; he's interested in him as a transformative figure who embodies a whole array of antitheses in one pompadoured, satin-and-glitter-clad person, like some trickster god of 20th century pop culture. ...A rich subject for a scholar and poet, and Kirby has a ball with it."<br>-St. Petersberg Times<br>"...it's hard to imagine [Little Richard] will ever find himself championed by a more enthusiastic and persuasive advocate."<em>Washington Post Sunday, December 2009</em><br><br>"...a huge cultural shift that Richard, unlike Elvis, say, has never been given full credit for.

They have illustrated many children's books.Grade 4-6-Life in 17th-century Korea is not easy for a girl, even for the daughter of a wealthy family. Jade Blossom must learn to do the laundry, sew the clothes back together after each washing, help in the kitchen, and embroider flawlessly. Her world is circumscribed by the walls of the Inner Court where she will spend her life until she marries and then will be confined to the Inner Court of her husband's household. However, when her aunt and best friend since childhood gets married, Jade is determined to see her again. Park maintains a fine tension between the spirited girl's curiosity and her very limited sphere. Certainly Jade looks for opportunities to expand her horizons, but after her first disastrous foray to see Willow, she learns that those chances have to come within the walls of her own home. The story is full of lively action and vivid descriptions, enhanced by appealing black-and-white paintings, to give a clear sense of the period and reveal the world as Jade sees it. Even the minor characters have substance. The girl's parents are understanding but not indulgent. Her father is a thoughtful man, distant from the family, but looking at the possibilities for the future of his country. Her mother recognizes Jade's longings and shows her that it is possible to be content with her life. Like Jade's stand-up seesaw, Park's novel offers readers a brief but enticing glimpse at another time and place.<br><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Menil Collection: A Selection from the Paleolithic to the Modern Era</h2><p>Shows selections from the art and sculpture of the new museum in Houston, including works by Warhol, Johns, Rauschenberg, Calder, Rothko, Dubuffet, Picasso, and Ernst</p><p></p><h2>Lucian Freud&#39;s Sketchbooks</h2><p><b>Previously unpublished drawings from the private sketchbooks of the pre-eminent British painter offer a new perspective on the artist&#x2019;s personality and artistic genius</b><br><br> This revelatory publication features a selection of beautifully reproduced images from the sketchbooks of Lucian Freud (1922&#x2013;2011), one of the world&#x2019;s greatest realist painters.

In On the Mend: Revolutionizing Healthcare to Save Lives and Transform the Industry John Toussaint, MD, former CEO of ThedaCare, and Roger A. Gerard, PhD, its chief learning officer, candidly describe the triumphs and stumbles of a seven-year journey to lean healthcare, an effort that continues today and that has slashed medical errors, improved patient outcomes, raised staff morale, and saved $27 million dollars in costs without layoffs. Find out: * How lean techniques of value-stream-mapping and rapid improvement events cut the average &#34;door-to-balloon&#34; time for heart attack patients at two hospitals from 90 minutes to 37. * What ThedaCare leaders did to replace medicine&#39;s &#34;shame and blame&#34; culture with a lean culture based on continuous improvement and respect for people. * How the lean principle of &#34;building in quality at the source&#34; broke down divisions among medical specialties allowing teams to develop patient care plans faster. * Why traditional modern management is the single biggest impediment to lean healthcare. * How the plan-do-study-act cycle coupled with rapid improvement events cut the wait time at a robotic radiosurgery unit from 26 days to six. * How the lean concept of &#34;one piece flow&#34; saved time in treating ischemic stroke patients, increasing the number of patients receiving a CT scan within 25 minutes from 51% to 89%. * How senior leaders at other healthcare organizations can begin their own lean transformations using a nine-step action plan based on what ThedaCare did -- and what it would do differently.

In The Argumentative Indian, Amartya Sen draws on a lifetime study of his country&#x2019;s history and culture to suggest the ways we must understand India today in the light of its rich, long argumentative tradition.<br>The millenia-old texts and interpretations of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim, agnostic, and atheistic Indian thought demonstrate, Sen reminds us, ancient and well-respected rules for conducting debates and disputations, and for appreciating not only the richness of India&#x2019;s diversity but its need for toleration. <br>Though Westerners have often perceived India as a place of endless spirituality and unreasoning mysticism, he underlines its long tradition of skepticism and reasoning, not to mention its secular contributions to mathematics, astronomy, linguistics, medicine, and political economy.<br>Sen discusses many aspects of India&#x2019;s rich intellectual and political heritage, including philosophies of governance from Kautilya&#x2019;s and Ashoka&#x2019;s in the fourth and third centuries BCE to Akbar&#x2019;s in the 1590s; the history and continuing relevance of India&#x2019;s relations with China more than a millennium ago; its old and well-organized calendars; the films of Satyajit Ray and the debates between Gandhi and the visionary poet Tagore about India's past, present, and future.<br>The success of India&#x2019;s democracy and defense of its secular politics depend, Sen argues, on understanding and using this rich argumentative tradition. It is also essential to removing the inequalities (whether of caste, gender, class, or community) that mar Indian life, to stabilizing the now precarious conditions of a nuclear-armed subcontinent, and to correcting what Sen calls the politics of deprivation. His invaluable book concludes with his meditations on pluralism, on dialogue and dialectics in the pursuit of social justice, and on the nature of the Indian identity.<br></p><p>Amartya Sen is Lamont University Professor at Harvard.

His most recent books are <i>Development as Freedom</i> (Knopf, 1999) and <i>Rationality and Freedom</i> (Harvard University Press, 2002)<i>. </i>His books have been translated into thirty languages<i>. </i><br><i>Preface</i><br><br>These essays on India were written over the last decade -- about half of them over the last couple of years. The first four, which make up the first part of the collection, introduce and explain the principal themes pursued in this book, related to India's long argumentative tradition.<br><br>India is an immensely diverse country with many distinct pursuits, vastly disparate convictions, widely divergent customs and a veritable feast of viewpoints. Any attempt to talk about the culture of the country, or about its past history or contemporary politics, must inescapably involve considerable selection. I need not, therefore, labour the point that the focus on the argumentative tradition in this work is also a result of choice. It does not reflect a belief that this is the only reasonable way of thinking about the history or culture or politics of India. I am very aware that there are other ways of proceeding.<br><br>The selection of focus here is mainly for three distinct reasons: the long history of the argumentative tradition in India, its contemporary relevance, and its relative neglect in ongoing cultural discussions. It can in addition be claimed that the simultaneous flourishing of many different convictions and viewpoints in India has drawn substantially on the acceptance -- explicitly or by implication -- of heterodoxy and dialogue. The reach of Indian heterodoxy is remarkably extensive and ubiquitous.<br><br>Consider the politically charged issue of the role of so-called 'ancient India' in understanding the India of today. In contemporary politics, the enthusiasm for ancient India has often come from the Hindutva movement -- the promoters of a narrowly Hindu view of Indian civilization -- who have tried to separate out the period preceding the Muslim conquest of India (from the third millennium BCE to the beginning of the second millennium CE). In contrast, those who take an integrationist approach to contemporary India have tended to view the harking back to ancient India with the greatest of suspicion. For example, the Hindutva activists like invoking the holy Vedas, composed in the second millennium BCE, to define India's 'real heritage'. They are also keen on summoning the <i>Ramayana</i>, the great epic, for many different purposes, from delineating Hindu beliefs and convictions to finding alleged justification for the forcible demolition of a mosque -- the Babri masjid -- that is situated at the very spot where the 'divine' Rama, it is claimed, was born. The integrationists, by contrast, have tended to see the Vedas and the <i>Ramayana</i> as unwelcome intrusions of some specific Hindu beliefs into the contemporary life of secular India.<br><br>The integrationists are not wrong to questions the factional nature of the choice of 'Hindu classics' over other products of India's long and diverse history. They are also right to point to the counterproductive role that such partisan selection can play in the secular, multi-religious life of today's India. Even though more than 80 per cent of Indians may be Hindu, the country has a very large Muslim population (the third largest among all the countries in the world -- larger than the entire British and French populations put together), and a great many followers of other faiths: Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Parsees and other.<br><br>However, even after noting the need for integration and for a multicultural perspective, it has to be accepted that these old books and narratives have had an enormous influence on Indian literature and thought. They have deeply influenced literary and philosophical writings on the one hand, and folk traditions of storytelling and critical dialectics on the other. The difficulty does not lie in the importance of the Vedas or the <i>Ramayana</i>, but in the understanding of their role in Indian culture. When the Muslim Pathan rulers of Bengal arranged for making good Bengali translations of the Sanskrit <i>Mahabbarata</i> and <i>Ramayana</i> in the fourteenth century (on which see Essay 3), their enthusiasm for the ancient Indian epics reflected their love of culture, rather than any conversion to Hinduism.[1] It would be as difficult to ignore their general importance in Indian culture (on some allegedly 'secular' ground) as it would be to insist on viewing them through the narrow prism of a particularly raw version of Hindu religiosity.<br>The Vedas may be full of hymns and religious invocations, but they also tell stories, speculate about the world and -- true to the argumentative propensity already in view -- ask difficult questions. A basic doubt concerns the very creation of the word: did someone make it, was it a spontaneous emergence, and is there a God who knows what really happened? As is discussed in Essay I, the <i>Rigveda</i> goes on to express radical doubts on these issues: 'Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?...perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not -- the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows -- or perhaps he does not know.' These doubts from the second millennium BCE would recur again and again in India's long argumentative history, along with a great many other questions about epistemology and ethics (as is discussed in Essay I). They survive side by side with intense religious beliefs and deeply respectful faith and devotion.<br><br>Similarly, the adherents of Hindu politics -- especially those who are given to vandalizing places of worship of other religions -- may take Rama to be divine, but in much of the <i>Ramayana</i>, Rama is treated primarily as a hero-a great 'epic hero' -- with many good qualities and some weaknesses, including a tendency to harbour suspicions about his wife Sita's faithfulness. A pundit who gets considerable space in the <i>Ramayana</i>, called Javali, not only does not treat Rama as God, he calls his actions 'foolish' ('especially for', as Javali puts it, 'an intelligent and wise man'). Before he is persuaded to withdraw his allegations, Javali gets time enough in the <i>Ramayana</i> to explain in detail that 'there is no after-world, nor any religious practice for attaining that', and that 'the injunctions about the worship of gods, sacrifice, gifts and penance have been laid down in the sabar;stras (scriptures) by clever people, just to rule over (other) people.'* The problem with invoking the <i>Ramayana</i> to propagate a reductionist account of Hindu religiosity lies in the way the spic is deployed for this purpose -- as a document of supernatural veracity, rather than as 'a marvellous parable' (as Rabindranath Tagore describes it) and a widely enjoyed part o India's cultural heritage.<br><br>The roots of scepticism in India go back a long way, and it would be hard to understand the history of Indian culture if scepticism were to be jettisoned. Indeed, the resilient reach of the tradition of dialectics can be felt throughout Indian history, even as conflicts and wars have led to much violence. Given the simultaneous presence of dialogic encounters and bloody battles in India's past, the tendency to concentrate only on the latter would miss something of real significance.<br><br>It is indeed important to understand the long tradition of accepted heterodoxy in India. In resisting the attempts by the Hindutva activists to capture ancient India as their home ground (and to see it as the unique cradle of Indian civilization), it is not enough to point out that India has many sources culture as well. It is necessary also to see how much heterodoxy there has been in Indian thoughts and beliefs from very early days. Not only did Buddhists, Jains, agnostics and atheists compete with each other and with adherents of what we now call Hinduism (a much later term) in the India of the first millennium BCE, but also the dominant religion in India was Buddhism for nearly a thousand years. The Chinese in the first millennium CE standardly referred to India as 'the Buddhist kingdom' (the far-reaching effects of the Buddhist connections between the two largest countries in the world are discussed in Essay 8). Ancient India cannot be fitted into the narrow box where the Hindutva activists want to incarcerate it.<br><br>It was indeed a Buddhist emperor of India, Ashoka, who, in the third Century BCE, not only outlined the need for toleration and the richness of heterodoxy, but also laid down what are perhaps the oldest rules for conducting debates and disputations, with the opponents being 'duly honoured in every way on all occasions'. That political principle figures a great deal in later discussions in India, but the most powerful defence of toleration and of the need for the state to be equidistant from different religions came from a Muslim Indian emperor, Akbar. This was of course much later, but those principles of religious toleration, enunciated in the I590s, were still early enough at a time when the inquisition was in full swing in Europe.<br><br>The contemporary relevance of the dialogic tradition and of the acceptance of heterodoxy is hard to exaggerate. Discussions and arguments are critically important for democracy and public reasoning. They are central to the practice of secularism and for even-handed treatment of adherents of different religious faiths (including those who have no religious beliefs). Going beyond these basic structural priorities, the argumentative tradition, if used with deliberation and commitment, can also be extremely important in resisting social inequalities and in removing poverty and deprivation. Voice is a crucial component of the pursuit of social justice.<br><br>It is sometimes asserted that the use of dialectics is largely confined to the more affluent and more literate, and is thus of no value to the common people. The elitism that is rampant in such a belief is not only extraordinary, it is made more exasperating through the political cynicism and impassivity it tends to encourage. The critical voice is the traditional ally of the aggrieved, and participation in arguments is a general opportunity, not a particularly specialized skill (like composing sonnets or performing trapeze acts).<br><br>Just before the Indian general elections in the spring of 2004, when I visited a Bengali village not far from my own home, I was told by a villager, who was barely literate and certainly very poor: 'It is not very hard to silence us, but that is not because we cannot speak.' Indeed, even though the recording and preservation of arguments tend to be biased in the direction of the articulations of the powerful and the well schooled, many of the most interesting accounts of arguments from the past involve members of disadvantaged groups (as is discussed in Essays 1 and 2).<br><br>The nature and strength of the dialogic tradition in India is sometimes ignored because of the much championed belief that India is the land of religions, the country of uncritical faiths and unquestioned practices. Some cultural theorists, allegedly 'highly sympathetic', are particularly keen on showing the strength of the faith-based and unreasoning culture of India and the East, in contrast with the 'shallow rationalism' and scientific priorities of the West. This line of argument may well be inspired by sympathy, but it can end up suppressing large parts of India's intellectual heritage. In this pre-selected 'East -- West' contrast, meetings are organized, as it were, between Aristotle and Euclid on the one hand, and wise and contented Indian peasants on the other. This is not, of course, an uninteresting exercise, but it is not pre-eminently a better way of understanding the 'East -- West' cultural contrast than by arranging meetings between, say, Aryabhata (the mathematician) and Kautilya (the political economist) on the one hand, and happily determined Visigoths on the other. If the immediate motivation for this book is social and political understanding in India, it has, I believe, some relevance also for the way the classification of the cultures of the world has become cemented into a shape that pays little or no attention to a great deal of our past and present.[2]<br><br>The four essays in Part I outline the nature, reach and relevance of the argumentative tradition in India. This includes, as is particularly discussed in Essays 1 and 2, the part that pluralism and the dialogic tradition play in supporting democracy, secularism and the pursuit of mathematics and science, and the use that can be made of dialectics in seeking social justice, against the barriers of class, caste, community and gender. Essay 3 discusses the relevance of a capacious understanding of a large and heterodox India, contrasted with the drastically downsized view of the country that appeals to some religious activists, who combine it with a severely miniaturized understanding of Hinduism.[3] These discussions have relevance, as is discussed in Essay 4, for the way Indian identity can be understood, and the diagnostic issues are relevant not only for Indians in India but also for the large (at least 20 million strong) Indian diaspora across the world.<br><br>The essays in Part II deal with the role of communication in the development and understanding of cultures. The discussions in Essays 5 and 6 try to follow and to develop the insights on this subject that emerge from the works of the visionary poet and writer Rabindranath Tagore and the great film director Satyajit Ray. The emergence of difference versions of 'imagined India' in Western perceptions is investigated in Essay 7, along with the impact that these misconceptions, in turn, have had on the way Indians have tended to see themselves in the colonial or post-colonial period. Essay 8 is devoted to examining the close and extensive intellectual relations (covering science, mathematics, engineering, literature, music, and public health care and administration) that China and India had -- along with religion and trade -- for a thousand years, beginning in the early part of the first millennium, and the lessons that emerge from all this for contemporary China and India.<br>Part III is concerned with the politics of deprivation (poverty, class and caste divisions, gender inequality) and with the precariousness of human security in the subcontinent as a result of the development of nuclear weapons in India and Pakistan. Essays 9-12 investigate what has happened and is happening right now, and what issues can appropriately be taken up for critical examination.<br><br>[1] As is also discussed in Essay 3, the first translation of the Upanisads -- the most philosophical part of the Vedic Hindu literature -- that caught the attention of European intellectuals was the Persian translation produced in the seventeenth century by the Moghal prince Dara Shikoh, the eldest son (and legitimate heir) of Emperor Shah Jahan and of Mumtaz Mahal (the beautiful queen on whose tomb the Taj Mahal would be built).

Do you wake up feeling rough? Then you`re philogrobolized. Pretending to work? That`s fudgelling, which may lead to rizzling if you feel sleepy after lunch, though by dinner time you will have become a sparkling deipnosophist. From Mark Forsyth, author of the bestselling The Etymologicon, this is a book of weird words for familiar situations. From ante-jentacular to snudge by way of quafftide and wamblecropt, at last you can say, with utter accuracy, exactly what you mean.</p><p><p><b>Mark Forsyth </b>is a writer, journalist, proofreader, ghostwriter, and pedant.

She lives in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, with her husband and two children.</p>Gr. 3-5. The fourth book in the Martha Years series, which relates the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Scottish great-grandmother, begins when 10-year-old Martha leaves home for the first time. Her older sister, Grisie MacDougal, now married and living in her father-in-law's household in Perth, welcomes Martha, and they grow closer than they had been at home. Old Mr. MacDougal dies during Martha's visit, an aspect of the story that is surprising and well handled, and the family has a <i>ceilidh,</i> a traditional celebration with food, fiddles, bagpipes, dancing, and storytelling for the whole community. Softly shaded pencil drawings enhance the chapter headings, and a few larger drawings illustrate the text of this appealing, episodic story. Obviously, children will recognize that the eighteenth-century Scottish setting is noticeably different in its social strictures and customs, but they will readily understand and identify with Martha's emotional reactions to what she finds around her, from her uncomfortable feelings at Mr. MacDougal's sudden illness and death to the loneliness of being the youngest child and the last one at home. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This bestselling devotional includes complete subject and Scripture indexes along with 366 timeless, inspirational devotions in a classic but affordable burgundy leather binding. Ideal for both the Chambers devotee and for gift-giving.</p><p>Oswald Chambers, a Scotsman who converted to Christianity in his teens under the ministry of Charles Spurgeon, has been affecting Christians with his devotional words since <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> was first published in 1935. This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>It&#39;s one of the top-selling devotionals of all time...it&#39;s updated into today&#39;s language...and now it&#39;s available in a contemporary new package, with four covers targeting different audiences.

Taken as payment for an outstanding debt, the little colt doesn't seem like he is worth much, but the kindly teacher asks one of his students, Joel Goss, to train him.

This true-life account told by the journalist who broke the story details the horrifying actions of this deviant doctor whose&nbsp;patients suffered serious infections, internal bleeding from nicked arteries, and the mutilation of healthy organs. Banned from surgical practice in the United States, the manipulative Patel managed to commit atrocities in an Australian hospital without consequences for two years. Finally, nurse Toni Hoffman exposed his horrifying behavior, which resulted in a Royal Commission investigation of Patel and the overall health system. This disturbing tale of grieving families and shattered lives challenges the faith that many have in medical systems.</p><p><p><strong>Hedley Thomas is an assistant editor at the <i>Brisbane Courier Mail</i>. He has received three Walkey awards and the Sir Keith Murdoch Award.</strong></p>Australian journalist Thomas' good news&#x2013;bad news&#x2013;worse news account of an egomaniacal American surgeon found responsible for many deaths is a story that, though true, is dramatic enough for fiction. The admittedly questionable good news is that the American medical system isn't the worst in the world. The bad news is that it's bad enough to have allowed Dr. Jayant Patel to continue in practice after several deaths were attributed to his surgical mishaps and then allowed him to start fresh at a Queensland, Australia, state hospital. The worst news is a scenario of the incredible flubs, misrepresentations, cover-ups, and snafus by which Patel, dubbed Dr. Death by Australian media, persisted and even thrived during what could be aptly described as a surgical reign of terror. For two long years, Patel's professional progress left maimed, irreversibly injured, and dead patients in its wake. Thanks to Thomas and an especially courageous, whistle-blowing nurse, Patel's lethal career eventually ended, and the Australian government began to clean up its medical act.

This is for the simple reason that human beings cannot comprehend how such feelings can exist at all, as everyone seemingly requires an incentive to perform any act; without some personal gain, people are not prepared to extend themselves. That is why a quality such as altruism can only be imparted to a person from Above, and only those who have experienced it can understand it.&#34; Attaining The Worlds Beyond is a first step toward discovering the ultimate fulfillment of spiritual ascent in our lifetime. This book reaches out to all those who are searching for answers, who are seeking a logical and reliable way to understand the world&#39;s phenomena.

These spiny succulents, which share many of the same arid habitats, have long been a source of fascination for explorers, naturalists, and scientists. <i>Cacti, Agaves, and Yuccas of California and Nevada</i> features more than 60 species with a detailed text that is accompanied by 262 color photographs, 16 botanical watercolors, and 52 range maps. Much more than a field guide, this book examines the natural history of California's and Nevada's cacti, agaves, and yuccas, including their origins, ecology, and conservation. It also provides practical horticultural advice for their cultivation and describes some of the best places to see these remarkable succulents in the wild. <p>Botanist, writer, and photographer Stephen Ingram traveled more than 30,000 miles, much of it on remote backroads, to search out, study, and photograph the cacti, agaves, and yuccas of California and Nevada. He also delved into the scientific literature, visited numerous herbaria, and interviewed our region's leading experts on Cactaceae and Agavaceae. The result is a detailed, highly readable, and beautifully illustrated natural history and field guide. <i>Cacti, Agaves, and Yuccas of California and Nevada</i> is an engaging and substantive reference book that can be enjoyed by novice and expert alike.</p></p><p>Stephen Ingram is a native Californian with a long-time interest in plants and plant ecology. He received a B.S. degree in Biology from Lewis and Clark College, and an M.A. degree in Botany from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Following graduate school, Stephen was employed as part of the Research Department at Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, Florida, managing the herbarium and working on an epiphyte flora of Monteverde, Costa Rica. He has also worked as a botanical consultant doing rare plant surveys in the Eastern Sierra and the Mojave Desert. Stephen is past president of the Bristlecone Chapter of the California Native Plant Society. His photos have been used in numerous books, magazines, and calendars.Stephen Ingram's book is not just a wealth of knowledge, it's also a collection of some of the best photographs I have seen, especially in a book on succulent plants. These images are of a quality that one would encounter in books on art and photography. His treatment of each species begins with a common name, the Latin binomial, a pronunciation key (to the binomial), a list of recent synonyms, and a compilation of other common names. He also provides a section on identifying characteristics, including habit, stems, spines, flowers, and fruits....If you're looking for a book to gain knowledge of these fascinating plants, or for one that's really helpful in identifying specimens, or just one with beautiful images, it's all here. ----Duke Benadom, Editor, <i>Cactus and Succulent Journal</i>, September-October, 2010<br><br>Stephen Ingram lives in the midst of cactus habitat, and his love of these and other prickly plants is evident in the pages of this book. The book serves not only as an overview of such desert plants, but doubles as a field guide, lavishly illustrated with Ingram's excellent photographs. Ingram's training as a botanist is revealed in his thorough approach to detailing the evolution, natural history and cultivation of the native cacti, agaves, and yuccas of California...The detailed profiles of the more than sixty species of cactus, yuccas, and agaves living in California and Nevada are excellent. They include precise descriptions of identifying characteristics as well as fine photographic illustrations and clear range maps...Amateur and professional botanists alike will find this new book informative at their desks and useful in the field. Ingram's combination of passion and science may help to foster a greater appreciation for these spiny plants as garden plants, and help assure the continued preservation of their austere, but beautiful desert habitats. ----Virginia Hayes, <i>Pacific Horticulture</i>, Fall 2008<br><br>What a beautifully illustrated book!...The paperback version is small and durable enough to carry into the field and large enough so that color images of landscapes show scenic vistas, habitats that characterize the desert ecosystem, and morphological details of individual plants, plant parts, and flowers...This book must be on the bookshelf of every library, botanist, ecologist, horticulturist, gardener, landscaper, conservationist, botanical museum, and herbarium. ----Harold W. Keller, Ph.D., <i>Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas</i>, Vol. 3, Issue 1, 2009<br><br>This is more than a small format coffee table book; the photos and range maps on their own will serve as useful tools for identifying plants...In addition to being a useful field guide, there are sections on culture, conservation, ecology, and places to see the plants in the wild. By placing much of the technical information in eight appendices, a key, and a glossary, Ingram doesn't bog down readers, but lets his prose keep them moving through the descriptions. ---- --Stephen McCabe, <i>The Bulletin</i>, UCSC Arboretum, Fall 2008</p><h2>The Spy Who Loved</h2><p>Just weeks after Germany invaded her homeland, Christine Granville, (born Krystyna Skarbek), the daughter of a Polish aristocrat, arrived in London and demanded to work for the British Secret Service.

She became Britain's first (and longest serving) female special agent, conducting undercover operations in two occupied countries and missions in numerous theaters of war, rescuing officers minutes before their execution and bringing hundreds of POWs back to the front lines. This story of how a charismatic Jewish Countess and beauty queen--raised to be a sedate society wife--parlayed her crackling vitality, flair for languages, and intrepid determination into action that directly undermined the Nazis makes for a sweepingly cinematic read. Churchill's favorite spy, one of the most decorated female intelligence agents of WWII, and one of her era's most liberated (and desired) women, Granville was driven by a passion for liberty "in love, in politics, and in life in the widest sense." Mulley has a sensitive, elegant, and wry way with Granville's story, informed by deep research into the scant published and complex unpublished material, and coupled with her own new interviews Christine's living friends and their children that vividly humanize her. And while her murder in 1952 at the hands of a jealous lover robbed her of the chance to fully realize her post-war promise, <em>The Spy Who Loved</em> is a marvelous tribute to her life and legacy. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><p>CLARE MULLEY is the author of <i>The Woman Who Saved the Children</i>: A Biography of Eglantyne Jebb, which won the <i>Daily Mail </i>Biographers' Club Prize.

A methodical and clear teacher, Owen systematically reveals how sin works to deceive and ultimate disable those who don&#x2019;t fully trust in God&#x2019;s amazing grace.</p></p><p>John Owen was born in 1616 in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire and died in Ealing, West London, in 1683. During his sixty-seven years he lived out a life full of spiritual experience, literary accomplishment, and national influence so beyond most of his peers that he continues to merit the accolade of 'the greatest British theologian of all time.' <br><br>Despite his other achievements, Owen is best famed for his writings. These cover the range of doctrinal, ecclesiastical and practical subjects. They are characterized by profundity, thoroughness and, consequently, authority. Andrew Thomson said that Owen 'makes you feel when he has reached the end of his subject, that he has also exhausted it.' Although many of his works were called forth by the particular needs of his own day they all have a uniform quality of timelessness. The Banner of Truth Trust has reprinted his Works in twenty-three volumes.</p><h2>Wagner: The Terrible Man and His Truthful Art</h2><p><p>How is it possible for a seriously flawed human being to produce art that is good, true, and beautiful? Why is the art of Richard Wagner, a very imperfect man, important and even indispensable to us?</p><br><p>In this volume, Father Owen Lee ventures an answer to those questions by way of a figure in Sophocles &#x2013;&nbsp;the hero Philoctetes. Gifted by his god with a bow that would always shoot true to the mark and indispensable to his fellow Greeks, he was marked by the same god with an odious wound that made him hateful and hated. Sophocles' powerful insight is that those blessed by the gods and indispensable to men are visited as well with great vulnerability and suffering.</p><br><p><i>Wagner: The Terrible Man and His Truthful Art</i> traces some of Wagner's extraordinary influence for good and ill on a century of art and politics &#x2013;&nbsp;on Eliot and Proust as well as on Adolf Hitler &#x2013;&nbsp;and discusses in detail Wagner's <i>Tannhouser</i>, the work in which the composer first dramatised the Faustian struggle of a creative artist in whom 'two souls dwell.' In the course of this penetrating study, Father Lee argues that Wagner's ambivalent art is indispensable to us, life-enhancing and ultimately healing.</p></p><p><p>'If you agree with me that art is a reason to be alive rather than a life-support system, you'll find plenty to stimulate and entertain in this book.'</p><p><b>M.

Math. Modern mathematics can appear fiendishly complex to the point where many of us believe we are largely ignorant of the subject. However, the truth is that all of us, whether we realize it or not, are &#34;folk mathematicians,&#34; unconsciously relating quantities and magnitudes, angles and vectors. Every time you ponder which muffin is bigger, divide a pizza into equal portions, count your change or even look at a clock, you are being a mathematician. By unraveling the fascinating evolution of mathematics, from its earliest beginnings to the most important modern breakthroughs, this book makes mathematics accessible and enjoyable. By the time you have finished your curious journey, you will understand the difference between a quadratic and cubic equation, be passingly familiar with the limits of infinity and have learned how to construct a level platform for your monumental pyramid. Hopefully, you will have come to agree with the words of John Dee, for whom the allure of mathematics was nothing less than a &#34;ravishing persuasion.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Life Code: The New Rules for Winning in the Real World</h2><p>In <i>Life Code: The New Rules for Winning in the Real World</i>, six-time <i>New York Times</i> #1 best-selling author Dr. Phil McGraw abandons traditional thinking and tells you the ugly truth about the users, abusers, and overall &#x201c;bad guys&#x201d; we all have in our lives.

Harnett</h2><p>In his short but productive career, William Michael Harnett (1848-1892) became the great American master of trompe-l'oeil still-life painting. His works, popular with the public long before they were appreciated by the art critics, "fool the eye" with their convincing, sharp-edged definition of form and careful rendering of materials.<br>This volume provides the first thorough examination of Harnett's career and its significance for the history of American art. Twenty-two essays by a roster of leading scholars examine three major areas: Harnett's relationship to his contemporaries, among them painters, patrons, critics, and the general public; his formative training and experiences; and the meaning of his themes for the audience that supported him. These essays discuss not only Harnett's own technical skill and artistic development, but also the aesthetic issues of illusionism and trompe l'oeil, Harnett's relationship to other painters working in a similar vein, and the implications of his subject matter. Ultimately, the essays help to resolve the question of how Harnett's technically skillful imitations of real objects fit the definition of "art" and what his popularity says about the culture in which he worked and lived.<br>Each of the editors has written an essay for this volume; other contributors include Henry Adams, Maria Chamberlin-Hellman, Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., Elizabeth Jane Connell, William H. Gerdts, Elizabeth Johns, Judy L. Larson, David M. Lubin, Chad Mandeles, Roxana Robinson, and Paul J. Staiti.<br>The forty-nine works reproduced in full color and arranged chronologically provide the first comprehensive survey of Harnett's work. A bibliography, chronology, and thorough index add to the reference value of this handsome volume.</p><p></p><h2>Upon a Dark Night</h2><p>Ebullient homicide detective Peter Diamond takes on a case in Bath, England, involving a mysterious female amnesiac who is somehow tied to two alleged suicides</p><p>Peter Lovesey is the author of the Peter Diamond mysteries, the Sergeant Cribb mysteries, and the Bertie, Prince of Wales books. He has received the Cartier Diamond Dagger, the Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere, and the Ellery Queen Readers&#39; Award, among many other honors. Peter lives in Chichester, England.It's tough heading a murder squad when nobody's getting murdered, and the good people of Bath persist in being good. Stressful is what it is, and it drives Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond to an ilk he detests: doctors. Diagnosis: hypertension caused by underwork. So, naturally, the brilliant if bumptious Diamond seizes on the apparent suicide of a lonely old farmer as an opportunity. Can he, in the interests of occupational therapy, convince the powers-that-be that suicide in this case is actually homicide? Resourceful bloke that he is, he pulls it off. Soon, then, there's another dead body on hand, this time a young woman's. Diamond's archrival, Detective Superintendent Wigfull, says the woman fell from the roof of the apartment building; Diamond insists she was shovedand once again he carries the day. What's more, he manages to connect the deaths to each other and then both to the disappearance of yet another young woman, an amnesiac. Flimsy at first, the evidence suddenly gains substance, and somewhat to his surprise Diamond turns out to have been right all along. For admirers of this oft-decorated series (Bloodhounds, 1996, etc.), the fun is as much in Diamond the browbeater as it is in Diamond the inductive reasoner. And once again the fat, sly, manipulative detective pushes his oddball charm to the limit. Better than okay, if a little overlong, for this fifth in the series. It begins intriguingly, but then, like the great man himself, gets flabby in the middle. As Diamonds go, give it, maybe, a couple of carats. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Loosely based on the life of Danish painter Einar Wegener who, in 1931, became the first man to undergo a sex-change operation, <i>The Danish Girl</i> borrows the bare bones of his story as a jumping-off point for an exploration of how Wegener's decisions affected the people around him. Chief among these is his Californian wife, Greta, also a painter, who unwittingly sets her husband's feet on the path to transformation. While trying to finish a portrait of an opera singer who has cancelled a sitting, she asks Einar to stand in for her subject, putting on her dress, stockings, and shoes. The moment silk touches his skin, he is shaken: <blockquote> Einar could concentrate only on the silk dressing his skin, as if it were a bandage. Yes, that was how it felt the first time: the silk was so fine and airy that it felt like a gauze--a balm-soaked gauze lying delicately on healing skin. Even the embarrassment of standing before his wife began to no longer matter, for she was busy painting with a foreign intensity in her face. Einar was beginning to enter a shadowy world of dreams where Anna's dress could belong to anyone, even to him. </blockquote> Greta soon recognizes her husband's affinity for feminine attire, and encourages him not only to dress like a woman, but to take on a woman's persona, as well. "Why don't we call you Lili?" she suggests. What starts out as a harmless game soon evolves into something deeper, and potentially threatening to their marriage. Yet Greta's love proves to be enduring if not immutable. As Einar inexorably transforms, he steps beyond "that small dark space between two people where a marriage exists" and Greta lets him go. <p> Ebershoff does a remarkable job of historical prestidigitation, creating the sights and sounds and smells of 1930s Denmark and making it seem easy. Even more remarkable is his treatment of Greta: he gets inside her head and heart, and renders her in such loving detail that her reactions make perfect sense. Einar is more of a cipher, and ultimately less interesting than his wife. But in the end, this is Greta's book and David Ebershoff has done her proud. <i>The Danish Girl</i> marks a promising fictional debut. <i>--Sheila Bright</i></p><p>David Ebershoff&#x2019;s debut novel, <i>The Danish Girl</i>, won the 2000 Lambda Literary Award for transgender fiction and has been adapted into a major motion picture starring Academy Award-winner Eddie Redmayne.

The Conference attracted the greatest minds in the western world, as well as innumerable princes, lawyers and prostitutes. And amid the confusion hoped to put Europe's house in order.In&nbsp;The Battle for Christendom, brilliant historian Frank Welsh delves into this important moment in history and shows that it is in fact one of the most central moments in European history.</p><p>Frank Welsh was born in Washington, County Durham, and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. His books include The Profit of the State, Uneasy City, Building the Trireme, A History of Hong Kong, and A History of South Africa. He lives in France and England.At the beginning of the 15th century, Christendom was in full decline, attacked from the outside by Islam and disrupted from within by schism regarding the office of the Pope. Until the Council of Constance (1414&#x2013;1418), three popes&#x2014;Gregory XII in Rome, Benedict XIII in Avignon and John XXIII in Germany&#x2014;ruled Christendom, provoking schism. In 1387, Sigismund, already the king of Czechoslovakia, became the Holy Roman Emperorthrough his political savvy and military acumen, and with the help of John XXIII convoked the Council of Constance. The council not only ended the schism but also returned the papacy to Rome for good&#x2014;electing Martin V as pope&#x2014;and condemned the heresies of reformers John Wycliffe and Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake for his positions on the Eucharist. Although the book offers a useful portrait of Sigismund, a little-known but important figure in church history, it has a plodding, workmanlike style and offers little new insight into the work of the council itself. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Responding to people's overwhelming attraction to anything frightening, this marvelous anthology of some of the very best English ghost stories combines a serious literary purpose with the simple intention of arousing a pleasurable fear of the doings of the dead.<br> As the first volume to present the full range and vitality of the ghost fiction tradition, this selection of forty-two stories, written between 1829 and 1968, demonstrates the tradition's historical development, as well as its major themes and characteristics. Though the genre reached its peak in the nineteenth century, it enjoyed a second flowering between the two World Wars and even now still attracts dedicated practitioners and readers. The anthology includes stories by Walter Scott, M. R. James, Bram Stoker, Rudyard Kipling, Edith Wharton, Somerset Maugham, T. H. White, and many others.<br> According to Edith Wharton, we can judge the success of a story by what she called its "thermometrical quality; if it sends a cold shiver down the spine, it has done its job and done it well." A host of writers have taken up the challenge of succeeding at this most demanding form of literary art, including both "specialists" such as J.S. Le Fanu and Algernon Blackwood, and other writers such as Henry James and H.G. Wells, for whom ghost stories constituted only a portion of their literary output. Stressing the important contribution women writers have made to the genre, the collection also offers eight stories by women, ranging from Amelia Edward's "The Phantom Ghost" (1864) to Elizabeth Bowen's "Hand in Glove" (1952).</p><p><br><strong>Michael Cox</strong> is a publisher and the author of a biography of M.R.

The Woolsey family (of sweetly anthropomorphized sheep) have just had their spring haircuts. However, an unexpected snow storm leaves the fields snow-covered and the three lambs shivery. Clever Granny saves the day by quickly knitting their shorn locks into new sweaters. Although the concept is appealing and well illustrated, the text is a bit too dense for the format. The more successful of the two books features the Hopkins family (of busy rabbit parents and their 15 children), who pitch in to plant the garden. But so many rabbits make a confusing mess of the radish patch. The clever mother rabbit organizes the children into teams of five, four, three, two and one. All are assigned specific, sequential tasks and, working together, they accomplish a lot. In both books, dePaola's clear paintings complement the clever storylines, making a pleasing, accessible series.

That's how the light gets in." --"Leonard Cohen <br>Christmas is approaching, and in Quebec it's a time of dazzling snowfalls, bright lights, and gatherings with friends in front of blazing hearths. But shadows are falling on the usually festive season for Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. Most of his best agents have left the Homicide Department, his old friend and lieutenant Jean-Guy Beauvoir hasn't spoken to him in months, and hostile forces are lining up against him. When Gamache receives a message from Myrna Landers that a longtime friend has failed to arrive for Christmas in the village of Three Pines, he welcomes the chance to get away from the city. Mystified by Myrna's reluctance to reveal her friend's name, Gamache soon discovers the missing woman was once one of the most famous people not just in North America, but in the world, and now goes unrecognized by virtually everyone except the mad, brilliant poet Ruth Zardo.</p><p>As events come to a head, Gamache is drawn ever deeper into the world of Three Pines. Increasingly, he is not only investigating the disappearance of Myrna's friend but also seeking a safe place for himself and his still-loyal colleagues. Is there peace to be found even in Three Pines, and at what cost to Gamache and the people he holds dear?</p></p><p><p>LOUISE PENNY is "The" "New York Times "and" Globe and Mail "bestselling author of eight previous Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels.

She lives in a small village south of Montreal with her husband, Michael.</p>ONE <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Audrey Villeneuve knew what she imagined could not possibly be happening. She was a grown woman and could tell the difference between real and imagined. But each morning as she drove through the Ville-Marie Tunnel from her home in east-end Montr�al to her office, she could see it. Hear it. Feel it happening. <br>The first sign would be a blast of red as drivers hit their brakes. The truck ahead would veer, skidding, slamming sideways. An unholy shriek would bounce off the hard walls and race toward her, all-consuming. Horns, alarms, brakes, people screaming. <br>And then Audrey would see huge blocks of concrete peeling from the ceiling, dragging with them a tangle of metal veins and sinews. The tunnel spilling its guts. That held the structure up. That held the city of Montr�al up. <br>Until today. <br>And then, and then&nbsp;&#x2026; the oval of daylight, the end of the tunnel, would close. Like an eye. <br>And then, darkness. <br>And the long, long wait. To be crushed. <br>Every morning and each evening, as Audrey Villeneuve drove through the engineering marvel that linked one end of the city with another, it collapsed. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d; She laughed to herself. At herself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d; <br>She cranked the music louder and sang loudly to herself. <br>But still her hands on the steering wheel tingled, then grew cold and numb, and her heart pounded. A wave of slush whacked her windshield. The wipers swept it away, leaving a half moon of streaky visibility. <br>Traffic slowed. Then stopped. <br>Audrey&#x2019;s eyes widened. This had never happened before. Moving through the tunnel was bad enough. Stopped in it was inconceivable. Her brain froze. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d; But she couldn&#x2019;t hear her voice, so thin was her breath and so great the howl in her head. <br>She locked the door with her elbow. Not to keep anyone out, but to keep herself in. A feeble attempt to stop herself from flinging open the door and running, running, screaming out of the tunnel. She gripped the wheel. Tight. Tight. Tighter. <br>Her eyes darted to the slush-spattered wall, the ceiling, the far wall. <br>The cracks. <br>Dear God, cracks. <br>And the half-hearted attempts to plaster over them. <br>Not to repair them, but hide them. <br> <i>That doesn&#x2019;t mean the tunnel will collapse,</i> she assured herself. <br>But the cracks widened and consumed her reason. All the monsters of her imagination became real and were squeezing out, reaching out, from between those faults. <br>She turned the music off so she could concentrate, hyper-vigilant. The car ahead inched forward. Then stopped. <br>&#x201c;Go, go, go,&#x201d; she pleaded. <br>But Audrey Villeneuve was trapped and terrified. With nowhere to go. The tunnel was bad, but what waited for her in the gray December sunlight was worse. <br>For days, weeks, months&#x2014;even years, if she was being honest&#x2014;she&#x2019;d known. Monsters existed. They lived in cracks in tunnels, and in dark alleys, and in neat row houses. They had names like Frankenstein and Dracula, and Martha and David and Pierre. And you almost always found them where you least expected. <br>She glanced into the rearview mirror and met two frightened brown eyes. But in the reflection she also saw her salvation. Her silver bullet. Her wooden stake. <br>It was a pretty party dress. <br>She&#x2019;d spent hours sewing it. Time she could have, should have, spent wrapping Christmas gifts for her husband and daughters. Time she could have, should have, spent baking shortbread stars and angels and jolly snowmen, with candy buttons and gumdrop eyes. <br>Instead, each night when she got home Audrey Villeneuve went straight to the basement, to her sewing machine. Hunched over the emerald green fabric, she&#x2019;d stitched into that party dress all her hopes. <br>She would put it on that night, walk into the Christmas party, scan the room and feel surprised eyes on her. In her clingy green dress, frumpy Audrey Villeneuve would be the center of attention. But it wasn&#x2019;t made to get everyone&#x2019;s attention. Just one man&#x2019;s. And when she had that, she could relax. <br>She&#x2019;d hand over her burden, and get on with life. The faults would be repaired. The fissures closed. The monsters returned to where they belonged. <br>The exit to the Champlain Bridge was in sight. It wasn&#x2019;t what she normally took, but this was far from a normal day. <br>Audrey put on her signal and saw the man in the next car give her a sour look. Where did she think she was going? They were all trapped. But Audrey Villeneuve was more trapped. The man gave her the finger, but she took no offense. In Qu�bec it was as casual as a friendly wave. If the Qu�b�cois ever designed a car, the hood ornament would be a middle finger. Normally she&#x2019;d give him a &#x201c;friendly wave&#x201d; back, but she had other things on her mind. <br>She edged into the far right lane, toward the exit to the bridge. The wall of the tunnel was just feet away. She could have stuck her fist into one of the holes. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right.&#x201d; <br>Audrey Villeneuve knew it would be many things, but all right probably wasn&#x2019;t one of them. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Three Pines Creations, Inc. <br></p><h2>The World According to Bob: The Further Adventures of One Man and His Streetwise Cat</h2><p><p>Bob Fever has swept the globe, with <i>A Street Cat Named Bob</i> vaulting its way to #7 on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list in its first week on sale.

If you are unfamiliar with the previous book (and shame on you), the author was a London street musician and recovering drug addict when he stumbled upon an ill ginger tabby, whom he named&#x2014;so �perfectly&#x2014;Bob. He fixed Bob up, and they have been inseparable ever since. The remarkable aspect of their friendship&#x2014;no, love&#x2014;is that Bob accompanied Bowen most days on his street-playing gig, attracting considerable attention in his own right. Now comes a sequel to that beguiling book, and this human-�feline team has not lost any of its extraordinariness. The primary focus in this second installment of the Bob story is the fame and fortune that came Bowen&#x2019;s way in the wake of the spectacular success of the first book. But is Bob no longer as vital to Bowen&#x2019;s life? Be serious. Bob&#x2019;s serenity has kept his now-famous owner grounded and aware of what&#x2019;s really important in life: the strength of love.

What set their armies apart? Noting this was an age that witnessed few technological advances, J. E. Lendon shows us that the most successful armies were those that made the most effective use of cultural tradition. Ancient combat moved forward by looking backward for inspirationthe Greeks, to Homer; the Romans, to the Greeks and to their own heroic past. The best ancient armies recruited soldiers from societies with strong competitive traditions; and the best ancient leaders, from Alexander to Julius Caesar, called upon those traditions to encourage ferocious competition at every rank.<br> Ranging from the Battle of Champions between Sparta and Argos in 550 B.C. through Julians invasion of Persia in A.D. 363, Soldiers and Ghosts brings to life the most decisive military contests of ancient Greece and Rome. Lendon places these battles, and the methods by which they were fought, in a sweeping narrative of ancient military history. On every battlefield, living soldiers fought alongside the ghosts of traditionghosts that would inspire greatness for almost a millennium before ultimately coming to stifle it.</p><p>What set the successful armies of Sparta, Macedon, and Rome apart from those they defeated? In this major new history of battle from the age of Homer through the decline of the Roman empire, J. E. Lendon surveys a millennium of warfare to discover how militaries change and don&#x2019;t change and how an army&#x2019;s greatness depends on its use of the past.<p></p><p></p>"This fascinating book is an eloquent reminder that ideals matter even more than technology in war, then and now. Athenian and Spartan generals, and Alexander in Asia fought their battles with Homer&#x2019;s Iliad in mind, mindful of the enduring Greek values of rivalry and cleverness. But (as Lendon encourages us to wonder) if Roman leaders had not continued this tradition of individual distinction, would fewer soldiers have died, and would the Roman Empire have been able to withstand the forces that eventually destroyed it?"&#x2014;Mary Lefkowitz, Wellesley College</p><h2>Mind,Mind Management and Raja Yoga</h2><p>Language: EnglishPages: 158 (Full Color &amp; B/W Illustrations)About the BookThe Yogadrishti (Yogavision) series of satsangs consists of discourses given by Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati in Munger as part of the new phase of Sannyasa life that he has embarked upon since 2009.Mind, mind Management and raja Yoga were the theme of the satsangs Swamiji gave in April and May 2010 at Ganga Darshan.In these illuminating discourses Swamiji puts the vast experience of the mind into easily comprehensible capsules.

With each passing year, we learn more about prevention and treatment of cancer. A cancer diagnosis is no longer tantamount to a death sentence. With treatment, people are living longer, and better, even after the cruel hand of cancer clamps their shoulders. </p><p> But what about after treatment? For many couples and families, even after successful treatment of cancer, the end of one battle signals the beginning of another, when a clean bill of physical health comes with a hefty price tag, and ends up costing the end of a marriage or relationship. </p><p> Kevin Murphy's searing and devastatingly honest story, Surviving Cancer after Surviving Cancer, offers a unique perspective on this all too common phenomenon, when cancer (or any life-threatening illness) erodes the foundation of a once happy, thriving relationship. It offers the hard won wisdom of a husband who stood by his cancer stricken wife as she endured immense physical and emotional suffering, and beat the cancer that threatened her life and their unborn child, only to succumb to a painful divorce less than a decade later. Part memoir, part self-help primer, Surviving Cancer after Surviving Cancer is a wakeup call to couples and families whose lives have been decimated by disease. It seeks to bridge the emotional gap that too often isolates citizens of sickness from their spouses, families, and friends.</p></p><p>Kevin L. Murphy, a former union truck driver and teacher, is an accomplished courtroom lawyer and speaker. Kevin received his law degree in 1981, and was a former columnist before writing this book. His story has helped countless people cope with cancer and their relationships. <p> Kevin is the founder of The Phyllis Foundation, a non-profit whose primary charitable focus is to get this book and its message to cancer patients everywhere. Kevin is the proud father of two wonderful daughters, Elizabeth and Kathleen Murphy.</p>Kevin wrote this book to help couples cope with the emotional side of this dreaded disease called cancer. But men take heed. Read this book and learn that when cancer comes to you, your wife, or a family member, it is okay to pray, weep, and most important of all, seek help from others. This book will make a difference in your life. --Dick Vitale, College Basketball Announcer<br><br>How does one put into words the human experience of Cancer? Kevin Murphy has accomplished this by way of his personal journey and fight against the ultimate fear of losing a wife/marriage, and ensuring the birth of two exceptional daughters. The emotional burden that Cancer places upon a marriage and family will certainly be minimized by reading this book and learning the evolution of change necessary to survive Cancer. --Peter J.

When odd, supernatural events plague the town of Comtosook, a ghost hunter is hired by the developer to help convince the residents that there&#x2019;s nothing spiritual about the property.<br> <br>Enter Ross Wakeman, a suicidal drifter who has put himself in mortal danger time and again. He&#x2019;s driven his car off a bridge into a lake. He&#x2019;s been mugged in New York City and struck by lightning in a calm country field. Yet despite his best efforts, life clings to him and pulls him ever deeper into the empty existence he cannot bear since his fianc�e&#x2019;s death in a car crash eight years ago. Ross now lives only for the moment he might once again encounter the woman he loves. But in Comtosook, the only discovery Ross can lay claim to is that of Lia Beaumont, a skittish, mysterious woman who, like Ross, is on a search for something beyond the boundary separating life and death. Thus begins Jodi Picoult&#x2019;s enthralling and ultimately astonishing story of love, fate, and a crime of passion.<br> <br>Hailed by critics as a &#x201c;master&#x201d; storyteller (<i>The Washington Post</i>), Picoult once again &#x201c;pushes herself, and consequently the reader, to think about the unthinkable&#x201d; <i>(Denver Post). Second Glance,</i> her eeriest and most engrossing work yet, delves into a virtually unknown chapter of American history&#x2014;Vermont&#x2019;s eugenics project of the 1920s and 30s&#x2014;to provide a compelling study of the things that come back to haunt us&#x2014;literally and figuratively. Do we love across time, or in spite of it?</p><p>Ghosts and ghost hunters collide in this compelling tale of the paranormal set in Vermont's green mountains. When the patriarch of the Abenaki Indian tribe that was nearly eradicated by that state's eugenics project in the 1930s encounters Ross Wakeman, the miraculous survivor of several attempted suicides who wants nothing more than to be reunited with the woman he loved and lost, they set in motion a chain of events that will unravel an ancient murder and lead to a second chance at life and love for the victim's descendants. Picoult, author of <i>Salem Falls</i>, brings the past alive and peoples it with a cast of extraordinarily well-realized characters whose reach into the future touches the lives of a dying boy, a frightened girl, and their mothers--two women who've given up on love until the revenants stirred up by a plan to develop an ancient burial ground show them what they're missing. <i>Second Glance</i> is an intricate and suspenseful ghost story that enchants and illuminates all the way to its powerful conclusion. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Jodi Picoult received an AB in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard.

As much as Silent Spring challenged American science to recognize its long-term responsibilities, Whyte's book asked communities, the government, and the design profession to do the same. Four decades later, this book is just as timely, the only difference is that the logic is now mainstream and the evidence is overwhelming."&#x2014;Paco Underhill, author of <i>Why We Buy</i></p><br><br><p>"An excellent book."&#x2014;Jane Jacobs</p></p><h2>Amagansett</h2><p>Conrad Labarde, a reclusive, first-generation Basque fisherman, finds his life transformed forever when he pulls up the body of a beautiful young woman in his fishing nets, in a story of love, death, and redemption set against the backdrop of a small Long Island fishing community in 1947. A first novel. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Mark Mills is a screenwriter whose credits include the script for <i>The Reckoning</i>, adapted from Barry Unsworth's novel <i>Morality Play</i>. <i>Amagansett</i> is his first novel.*Starred Review* When a literary thriller succeeds beyond genre, it's often because the book's sense of place gives it extra depth. So it is in this striking first novel about a shocking murder in the Long Island community of Amagansett in the years immediately following World War II. When Basque fisherman Conrad Labarde lands the body of a New York socialite in his net, he knows it means trouble--for the Long Island natives, struggling to preserve their way of life against the onslaught of Manhattan wealth, and especially for him personally, since the victim was his lover. Screenwriter Mills expertly blends the fascinating history of Long Island's south shore into his story, incorporating not only the stories of immigrant fishermen but also those of Native Americans, the first group to be dispossessed as the island became more attractive to rich people. The novel combines a touching love story, told in flashback, with a nicely detailed procedural starring an unlikely investigative duo: the taciturn Basque and the Amagansett assistant police chief, who hopes to resurrect his career in the wake of scandal. Literarily inclined cop-novel fans will be reminded of Michael Malone, while nongenre types will find elements of John Casey's <i>Spartina</i> (1989) in the fishing story and in the conflict between locals and summer people. This is a novel to savor, both for its portrait of rough-hewn individuals finding selfhood beyond the breakers and for its snapshot of the postwar world not yet locked in the death grip of modernity. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Richard and Rachael Heller, the #1 New York Times bestselling authors and pioneers in carbohydrate-smart dieting, it is now easier than ever to shed those extra pounds permanently. Unlike many low-carb and low-fat cookbooks, which skimp on taste, The Carbohydrate Addict?s Cookbook seizes on the dynamic flavors of a rich crop of foods, from tasty appetizers and hearty soups to succulent seafood and sinfully delicious salads, from vegetarian alternatives to traditional, down-home beef and poultry dishes and easy-to-make breakfasts. With a special section on "Quick Fix Dishes and Snacks," this is the one low-carb cookbook you will rely on every day.</p><p>?Herbed Cheese Dip ? Hearty Breakfast Quiche ?

Parsley Buttered "Steaks"</p></p><p>Richard and Rachael Heller, both research scientists and professors, have taken the dieting world by storm with their bestselling <i>Carbohydrate Addict's Diet</i> and <i>Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Program</i>. Now there's a companion cookbook, which adherents to their carbohydrate-cutting regimen can use from sunup to sundown without fear of straying from their dietary objectives. With only a short introduction on the basic goal of the diet--to limit insulin intake in order to lessen carbohydrate cravings and thereby lose weight--this cookbook presents 250 easy recipes that range from appetizers and breakfasts to meat, seafood, and vegetarian entr�es and snacks.<p> Those who have not already read <i>The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet</i> or related titles and are not familiar with the program's strategy may at first find the many high-fat recipes included here counterintuitive to the notion of a diet. But the idea is simple: eliminate the foods that trigger overeating--starches, snack foods, and sweets--and replace them with protein-rich, fibrous meals that help to normalize blood-sugar levels and curb the impulse to binge. Such an approach allows for higher fat consumption--the body metabolizes fat more efficiently when there is less insulin in the blood stream--and even has the psychologically beneficial side effect of permitting a certain amount of indulgence. People usually leery of diets because they don't want to give up their weekly cheeseburger will be awed by recipes such as the egg- and cream-augmented Left Bank Burgers. Likewise, the Herbed Cheese Dip with cheddar, cream cheese, and sour cream is a startlingly deluxe accompaniment for the normally ascetic plate of raw veggies; the Crustless Spinach Pie entices with its rich mix of feta, Parmesan, eggs, herbs, and olive oil.</p><p> The Hellers' approach to cooking is by no means highbrow and their recipes are often simply no-starch variations on standard fare (Steak in a Blanket replaces the dough with romaine lettuce, for example). An unspecified teriyaki sauce is a staple in their kitchen, and experienced cooks may wonder if they really mean tamari or soy sauce. People who have health restrictions on salt and alcohol (a few recipes call for wine) will want to have the original <i>Carbohydrate Addict's Diet</i> book handy in order to look up suitable alternatives--they are not included with this cookbook. That inconvenience aside, dieters will have no qualms about these tasteful recipes as they eat their way toward a slimmer, healthier future. <i>--Rebecca Wright</i></p>In their #1 New York Times bestselling books The Carbohydrate Addict&#x2019;s Diet and The Carbohydrate Addict&#x2019;s LifeSpan Program, Drs.

Nora&#x2019;s family life isn&#x2019;t going so well either: her bullying brother, Hector, is growing more threatening by the day, her mother is helpless and falling behind on the rent, and her father calls only on holidays. All Nora wants is to turn eighteen and be on her own. And while there <i>is </i>a cute new guy who started working with her at the deli, is dating even worth the risk when the killer likes picking off couples who stay out too late? Award-winning author Meg Medina transports us to a time when New York seemed balanced on a knife-edge, with tempers and temperatures running high, to share the story of a young woman who discovers that the greatest dangers are often closer than we like to admit &#x2014; and the hardest to accept.</p><p><b>Meg Medina</b> is the author of the Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning book <i>Merci Su�rez Changes Gears</i>, which was also a 2018 Kirkus Prize finalist.

The character development is tight and accurately constructed. Medina holds nothing back, shedding light on the characters&#x2019; flaws, which teens today will be able to relate to. Medina is on point with the teen voices, evoking their intense fear, panic, and dreams. A devastatingly intense story, this work is a must-have for all collections, especially where Ruta Sepetys&#x2019;s books are popular.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>This vividly evoked coming-of-age story is set against actual events in 1977 New York City...Nora is an empathetic character, and Medina depicts her troubled family and their diverse Queens neighborhood with realistic, everyday detail. Numerous references to New York&#x2019;s budget crisis, arson wave, and &#x201c;Son of Sam&#x201d; newspaper stories deliberately ground the story in a real time and place, while an ample sprinkling of seventies disco and funk song references creates a brighter soundtrack for the dreams and romance of teenage girls, hinting at a hopeful future for Nora.<br>&#x2014;The Horn Book (starred review)<br><br>Nora is strong and believable, a possible romance has heat, and Medina (<i>Yaqui Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass</i>) gets gritty 1977 New York City right: feminism and disco in the air, Son of Sam, and&#x2014;come July&#x2014;the blackout and the ensuing looting and fires...elements in this coming-of-age story are elegantly and eloquently explored.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;ve ever called a book &#x201c;masterful&#x201d; before, but I&#x2019;m more than a little tempted.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Historical fiction is sometimes a hard sell for contemporary teens; however, Medina&#x2019;s novel entices readers by developing realistic characters and a strong plot framed by the turbulence of 1977 in NYC. At its heart, this is a novel about growing up. Nora struggles to find her identity outside of her family and make choices that will impact her future. There is a strong theme of feminism and redefining a woman&#x2019;s role during that time in history. Nora&#x2019;s outlook on relationships and life in general is frank but refreshingly honest...this novel is a strong choice for its message, characters, and historical perspective.<br>&#x2014;VOYA<br><br>Medina steeps her narrator in a period world of wearing Sasson jeans, mourning for Freddie Prinze, and screaming at <i>Carrie, </i>but mostly it&#x2019;s an atmosphere of palpable and excruciating tension for Nora as her family drama mirrors the external threat.

Her special knowledge leads her to Oakland, California where she uses it to help the local Indian community by opening a spice shop from which she administers spices as curatives. Tilo can see into people's hearts and minds but it is a mistress's duty to keep herself at a distance, "not too far nor too near, in calm kindness poised." However, Tilo is unable to obey her charge, and she becomes emotionally involved with her customers as they struggle with the demands of their families, the clash of the old way versus the American way, racism, abusive husbands-all of the complexities of living in the modern world. <br><br>It is also her duty to limit her involvement to the Indian community. But Tilo finds herself mysteriously drawn to an American man named Raven, whose innermost thoughts she cannot read. Her complex and passionate relationships with her customers and Raven are in violation of her spice mistress vows, and so she finds herself forced to choose between the magical of an immortal and the vicissitudes of life in the real world. Vibrant, vivacious, headstrong and daring, Tilo is unforgettable and so is her story."</p><p>On a mythic island of women "where on our skin, the warm rain fell like pomegranate seeds" powerful spices like cinnamon, turmeric, and fenugreek whisper their secrets to young acolytes. Ordained after trial by fire, each new spice mistress is sent to a far-off land to cure the life pains of all Indian seekers, while keeping a cool distance from the mortals. Only stubborn, passionate Tilo, disguised as an old woman merchant in present-day Oakland, California, fails to heed the vengeful spices' warnings.

This heartfelt novella lets readers share Christmas with the Worthams and the Hammonds and discover the strength of faith, love, and family.</p><p>&#34;Wearily, I went on to bed, glad for the opportunity to rest my head on the soft pillow, even though the bed itself wasn&#39;t such a comfort with the mattress pulled off and lying in the next room. But tonight I knew I was too tired to care much about that. I figured I&#39;d be asleep almost instantly. But my foot sliding beneath the sheets seemed to find something that didn&#39;t belong. Reaching down with one hand I found what felt like a roll of paper. Thankfully, Samuel hadn&#39;t blown out the candle yet, or I might have crumpled it without thinking. In the dim light, I could see what it was. Franky&#39;s little paper baby Jesus. How he&#39;d gotten in our bed, I might never know.&#34;A Christmas of Healing It is December of 1932, just one year after the Worthams and the Hammonds lost both a dear mother and a selfless friend in one terrible night.

Can Julia Wortham restore hope and joy to so many forlorn children? With too many mouths, too little money, and a mysterious illness taking hold of some of the children, she has her doubts that God will pull them through. But she wasn&#39;t counting on the miracle of a simple, paper nativity.</p><h2>North of Hope: A Daughter&#39;s Arctic Journey</h2><p>After her parents are killed in a rare grizzly attack, the author is forced into a wilderness of grief.

There is nothing sentimental in these pages. North of Hope shows us how personal loss and loss of our planet come from the same place: Love. This is a testament to deep change, human and wild. -- Terry Tempest Williams, author, When Women Were Birds<br><br>Daring, perceptive, and eloquent---Polson&#x2019;s writing is clear and forceful. Like all true pilgrimages, this one is challenging, and well worth taking. -- Scott Russell Sanders, author, Earth Works and A Conservationist Manifesto<br><br>Polson&#x2019;s extraordinary journey draws you into the depths of anguish and brings you back out realizing that while not all things fractured can be healed, the soul will gravitate toward beauty, art, and meaning if guided in the right direction. -- Alison Levine, mountaineer, polar explorer, and team captain of the first American Women&#x2019;s Everest Expedition<br><br>North of Hope is an enthralling story of loss, courage, and redemption told by a gifted, original, and brave new voice, Shannon Huffman Polson. -- Robert Clark, award-winning author of ten books, including Dark Water and Mr. White&#x2019;s Confession<br><br>As Shannon Polson poignantly recounts the loss of family members to a grizzly attack in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, framing her memoir around her own trek into the wilderness where they perished, she comes to believe that there is grace and wonder in the most unlikely places, that the landscape&#x2019;s wildness can teach you about letting go of control, and that Easter doesn&#x2019;t arrive until you&#x2019;ve experienced Good Friday. Anyone who has endured the grief of losing someone or something they loved will identify with the advice Polson was given: &#x201c;When tragedy comes into your life, the most beautiful thing you can do is keep moving forward.&#x201d; -- Cindy Crosby, former National Park Ranger and author of By Willoway Brook (www.cindycrosby.com)<br><br>Shannon Polson brilliantly tells the story of venturing into the Alaskan wilderness to find the place where her parents were killed.

She writes with clarity, honesty, and poise. The end of her story has the surreal feel of fiction---a moment so unbelievable and fitting that it must have happened. Readers will find themselves caught up in that poetic end, and in the breadth of story that comes before it. -- Andrea Palpant Dilley, author, Faith and Other Flat Tires: Searching for God on the Rough Road of Doubt<br><br>North of Hope, Shannon Polson&#x2019;s gripping account of the shattering, traumatic loss of her father, is a must read.

It is only after her father&#x2019;s death that she truly listens to, and embraces, his message---to believe in her own strength and to live a life of meaning and purpose. Shannon&#x2019;s book is a gift to everyone who reads this powerful, inspiring story. -- Janet Hanson, CEO and founder, 85 Broads<br><br>North of Hope is a remarkable story about the power of the wilderness both to harm and to heal, and to provide strength and sustenance to the human spirit, no matter what the challenges. -- Nicholas O&#x2019;Connell, author, The Storms of Denali; instructor, www.thewritersworkshop.net</p><h2>A Sorrow Beyond Dreams: A Life Story (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Peter Handke's mother was an invisible woman.

On his fateful final mission in Afghanistan, his SEAL team was sent to recover Bowe Bergdahl&#x2014;the soldier who deserted his post and fell into the hands of Al-Qaida and the Taliban. The mission went south, and Hatch was left with a shattered femur from an AK-47 round and the SEAL dog who fought alongside him was dead. As a result of his horrific leg wound, his twenty-four-year military career came to an end&#x2014;and with it the only life he&#x2019;d ever known.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In <i>Touching the Dragon</i>, we witness his long road to recovery. Getting well physically required eighteen surgeries, twelve months of recovery, and learning to walk again. But getting well mentally would prove to be much tougher, as he fought through the depths of despair, alcoholism, and the pull to end his own life. What emerges is a different kind of hero&#x2019;s journey, one in which Hatch shows the courage it takes to confess, confront, and overcome his own brokenness. Through the love of family, friends, and his military dogs, Hatch learned remarkable tools and found his purpose, and now he wants to share this wisdom with the rest of us because we all have wounds.</p><p>JAMES HATCH is a retired member of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group.

The benefit of a dark helicopter running no lights and flying just a few feet off the ground is that it&#x2019;s hard for the bad guys to see. The downside to a dark helicopter running no lights is that it makes it hard for passengers like me to get in much quality personal reading. So, on deployments, I solved the problem by carrying small editions of Neruda, Epictetus, or Marcus Aurelius&#x2019;s <i>Meditations </i>in my pocket, and when I was coming back from work in the blacked-out helo at night, I&#x2019;d read the books by ChemLite.<br><br>The helo would often be full of me and my buddies, and our captives. All you heard was rotor drone, and all you smelled was ripe bodies&#x2014;the captives&#x2019; bodies tending to be a tad riper than ours. The loudness, the wind through the open doors, and the assembled company all made for a nice little cocktail of ambience that I found conducive to reading. I used these brief respites to gather some perspective.<br><br>Within minutes of being involved in violence, when I felt the full weight of the human ugliness I&#x2019;d just seen, I reached for these writers. Their words were a balm. They helped me not lose hope in the rest of humanity. They also mitigated my self-indictment and helped me deal with my own moral flaw: I liked the violence. I liked going out to kill people who wanted to harm innocents, and I was saddened by this fact. Saddened and a bit shocked at the appetite I had for it. Reading those books made me feel less like a monster.<br><br>I started out by reading Epictetus. He said each of us is merely a tiny soul propping up a corpse. I appreciated those uplifting words. It helped me realize that I didn&#x2019;t need to worry too much about the fate of my corpse, which was a relief, because it was in jeopardy a lot of the time. Aurelius followed naturally in my syllabus, as he was a fan of Epictetus. He relayed the comforting insight that death is merely part of nature, so don&#x2019;t fear or fight it. All you can do is greet it with equanimity when it comes and, in the meantime, live cheerfully and with purpose. Some have paraphrased this as &#x201c;death smiles on all of us, and all we can do is smile back.&#x201d; I thought about that on a few occasions. I honestly didn&#x2019;t believe that there was anything better or more meaningful than what I was doing. So, for me, death was never a terror. If I died in a gunfight, it would be doing something I loved. And besides, courtesy of Epictetus, I was less worried about the fate of my corpse.<br><br>For much of my adult life, my identity was almost entirely defined by being on what I call the Speeding Train&#x2014;being with the crew that was essentially my family. It was intense. Fulfilling. Addictive. There was an enemy out there who wanted to hurt people, so we&#x2019;d hurt them first. We were good at what we did. Surrounded by a lot of violence, we experienced clean, shining edges of time, where skill, brotherhood, trust, and purpose all melded into something that I can only describe with the word &#x201c;pure.&#x201d; Gunfights in the darkness, on enemy turf, were where we were happy. As guys in my unit liked to say, we were &#x201c;good at playing away games.&#x201d;<br><br>I guess, in some ways, being on the Speeding Train, at full throttle, was one long exercise in us smiling back.<br><br>That said, there were horrors, plenty of them, where the only one smiling was death. Horrors like the moments when innocent folks near the bad ones got caught up. Horrors like the Operation Red Wings disaster, where sixteen Special Operations personnel on their way to rescue an ambushed recon team were all killed by one rocket-propelled grenade to a helicopter. I was part of a group of Rangers and Navy guys sent into Afghanistan&#x2019;s Kunar Province to find and retrieve their charred and dismembered corpses. I remember coming home a few weeks after I&#x2019;d been a part of that recovery effort. All of those body bags and the nastiness of the violence were fresh in my mind, and I had to go with my wife, Kelley, to run a few errands. One of them involved a trip to a consumer electronics store, where I was overwhelmed. The folks in the store were all looking at the same thing: fifty huge TV screens featuring <i>American Idol</i>. Totally engrossed. And it made me realize that a long-held suspicion of mine was true. In the normal world, I was an alien.<br><br>It&#x2019;s in moments like those that I was glad for the books. Aurelius reminds us of the importance of remaining true to our nature, and to our fellow man, in spite of the extremities and alienation of war. Remembering that despite all of the negatives and violence involved, you are fortunate to be exposed to moments where you see true human greatness in your crew. I sure did. I saw valor and cunning and unsurpassed focus. I was lucky to be part of a group that was thrust into moments where we were all removed from our normal meandering human selfishness and catapulted to a higher plane. A place where your idea of failure really had nothing to do with you. Failure was not being there in the moment to take care of your crew.<br><br>Curiously, the moments in my life where I&#x2019;ve felt the most peace were in gunfights. Without a word being spoken, you knew what the people with you were thinking, and you knew that they had your back. You felt a seriously clear peace.<br><br>At home, those peaceful, clear moments were rare for me. So I retreated to war. To my crew. To constant deployments. This was unkind to Kelley.<br><br>I felt so at home in the one world, and so much like an alien in the other, that I started to think that the civilian world back home would never understand me, and that it held nothing for me.<br><br>This was a dangerous psychological division, but I cultivated it, even though Aurelius had tried to warn me. He made the point that even an emperor struggles. You may think you can exist in a heightened state forever, but humility comes eventually. I don&#x2019;t care who you are. At some point, you will be forced to reckon with your actions and deal with harsh realities. It&#x2019;s true for emperors. It&#x2019;s true for everyone. And it would turn out to be especially true for me.<br><br>When I was shot in Afghanistan during a mission to rescue Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, one war ended for me and another began. I&#x2019;d served as a member of Naval Special Warfare for most of my twenty-five years and eleven months in the Navy. Because of our training and skill sets, and because of a typical psychological hard-wiring, people in my particular unit are comfortable and clear-headed in situations where panic is probably the more natural response. I&#x2019;d always felt my ability to work and focus was enhanced, not diminished, by things going sideways suddenly. But when that lucky shot from the panicking enemy hit me, things went sideways in a new way, a way I was less well equipped to handle. I was forced to stop operating with my unit and reintegrate into a society that I had spent two decades defending, but in which I didn&#x2019;t feel I had a place.<br><br>Stepping off the Speeding Train caused me to lose my mind. I had almost always been an asset&#x2014;to my team and my country. Now, all I could think about was the fact that I was a liability. I no longer had a sense of purpose. I wrestled&#x2014;poorly&#x2014;with a tough question: What do you do when you&#x2019;re suddenly divorced from your calling? In need of help, but unable to ask for it, I despaired, abused alcohol, and became suicidal. At one point, I even unfairly involved my wife in some pathetic gunplay.<br><br>It took a courageous, no-bullshit group of people who inserted and sometimes forced themselves into my life to get me to the point where I was equipped to receive help, and also to help myself. These people make up a chain that I credit with saving my life and my mind&#x2014;a chain that starts with the friends in the firefight who risked their lives to save me on the battlefield, and runs all the way through the field hospital doctors, stateside surgeons, volunteers, fellow veterans, psychologists, and family that are still there for me today.<br><br>How they saved me&#x2014;at war, and at home&#x2014;is quite a story. People will rightly assume that I saw amazing things as a warfighter. But I saw equally amazing things as a recovering person.<br><br>In gunfights, what made us potent was not the gear, guns, and macho nonsense that movies and video games sensationalize. It was drive, professionalism, and love for each other&#x2014;the same traits I saw in the segment of society that saved my life and repaired my spirit after I was shot. The difference is, the heroes of my second war will never get medals for the work they did.<br><br>So let this be their tribute.</p><h2>Japanese Prints</h2><p>The Ukiyo-e print was a dominant and popular art form in Japan - from the 17th to 19th centures - showing street scenes, lovers&#39; assignations, portraits of courtesans and actors, landscapes and travelogues. &#34;Japanese Prints&#34; consists of 139 reproductions by 47 grand masters of this art form. Grouped by artist, each print is accompanied by detailed commentary.

Heroic as the original Trylon and Perisphere may have been, they spawned a mountain of kitsch--from bookends to salt and pepper shakers--itself a testimonial to American business initiative, and amply displayed here.

Surveying the study of prejudice since World War II, Young-Bruehl suggests an approach that distinguishes between different types of prejudices, the people who hold them, the social and political settings that promote them, and the human needs they fulfill. Startling, challenging, and courageous, this work offers an unprecedented analysis of prejudice.</p><p>Elisabeth Young-Bruehl was a psychotherapist at the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. She was the author of two well-known biographies, one of Hannah Arendt and one of Anna Freud, as well as other works including <i>Freud on Women</i>, <i>Creative Characters</i>, <i>Mind and the Body</i> (a collection of essays), and a novel, <i>Vigil</i>.&#x201c;Young-Bruehl argues that anti-Semitism, racism, sexism and homophobia differ in their internal logic (or illogic) and, more important, that they are deeply rooted in character structure and the unconscious. Accordingly, she finds the most convincing evidence about prejudices not in the questionnaires and projective tests favored by social scientists but in the writings of psychoanalysts, philosophers, novelists, critics and historians. Above all, she finds it in the writings of the victims of prejudice themselves...Her interpretations boast the familiar psychoanalytic virtues of richness, nuance and complexity: they probe to a psychological depth appropriate to the intensity and irrationality of the ideas in question...As an analysis of the sources of prejudice, <i>The Anatomy of Prejudices</i> is bold and profound. Along with Theodor Adorno's <i>Authoritarian Personality</i>, Hannah Arendt's <i>Origins of Totalitarianism</i>, Gordon Allport's <i>Nature of Prejudice</i> and Gavin Langmuir's <i>Toward a Definition of Antisemitism</i>, it is one of the rare studies to explore this vexed topic with the conceptual ambition and passion it deserves.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Robinson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Young-Bruehl is a perceptive observer.

Such a conceptual approach requires careful psychological distinctions, and to make them, the author calls upon her thorough, nuanced knowledge of psychoanalytic thinking.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Coles</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Anatomy of Prejudices</i> is a book of epic proportions that is sure to stimulate debate on many levels inside and outside the academy.

Implications will be drawn concerning current warring groups and political agendas. Indeed, it is of such vast scope that it may invite discourse for some time to come. The goal of this ambitious study is to propose an alternative to theories of prejudice that are familiar from the social sciences...[which] tend to treat prejudice as itself a single, universal concept and to construct a general theory intended to apply to all forms of prejudice...The book exhibits the wide and deep erudition that its task demands. It critically surveys and analyzes the most influential psychological and social scientific theories that have shaped academic study and popular understanding of prejudice...<i>The Anatomy of Prejudices</i> is a striking achievement that may well alter profoundly the way we think of prejudices.

This relationship is often thought tangential. But for Young-Bruehl, it is an intimate relationship. She thinks of individual psychopathologies and socially mediated hatreds as conceptually bound...[Young-Bruehl] presents the phenomena of racisms, sexisms, homophobias and anti-Semitism mainly through the use of historical and literary texts.

Lawrence (1885-1930) made a contribution to poetry that, in the words of Lousie Bogan, 'can now be recognized as one of the most important, in any language, of our time.' Birds, Beasts, and Flowers!, his first great experiment in free verse, was published when he was thirty-eight. This Black Sparrow edition re-sets the text in the format of the first edition (New York: Thomas Seltzer, 1923) and restores several 'indecent' lines suppressed by the original publisher. Lawrence's original jacket artwork is reproduced on the jacket in full color.<br><br>Many of these individual poems are popular in anthologies - they are best read, however, in the context and continuum of the whole book. In preparing the original collection for publication, Lawrence grouped the poems in a purposeful sequence and prefaced many of the subsections with brief quotations from the third edition of John Burnet's Early Greek Philosophy, which particularly interested him at the time. A Black Sparrow Press book by David R. Godine.</p><p>David Herbert Lawrence was born in 1885 in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, England. Though better known as a novelist, his first published works were poems, and his poetry, especially his evocations of the natural world, have since had a significant influence on many poets on both side of the Atlantic. He was charged with obscenity and persecuted during World War I for the supposed German sympathies of his wife, Frieda. Consequently, they traveled around the world, spending considerable time in Taos, New Mexico, where Lawrence became a celebrity attraction. He died in France in 1930.Birds, Beasts and Flowers is the peak of Lawrence's achievement as a poet...Like the romantics [his] starting point in these poems is a personal encounter between himself and some animal or flower, but, unlike the romantics, he never confuses the feelings they arouse in him with what he sees and hears and knows about them. The lucidity of his language matches the intensity of his vision; he can make the reader see what he is saying as very few writers can. --WH Auden<br><br>He believed in writing poetry that was stark, immediate and true to the mysterious inner force which motivated it. Many of his best-loved poems treat the physical and inner life of plants and animals; others are bitterly satiric and express his outrage at the puritanism and hypocrisy of conventional Anglo-Saxon society. --Academy of American Poets<br><br>Birds, Beasts and Flowers is the peak of Lawrence's achievement as a poet...Like the romantics [his] starting point in these poems is a personal encounter between himself and some animal or flower, but, unlike the romantics, he never confuses the feelings they arouse in him with what he sees and hears and knows about them.

He was 45: a literary legend, a national treasure, married with ten children. This meeting sparked a love affair that lasted over a decade, destroying Dickens's marriage and ending with Nelly's near-disappearance from the public record. In this remarkable work of biography, Claire Tomalin rescues Nelly from obscurity, not only returning the neglected actress to her rightful place in history, but also giving us a compelling and truthful account of the great Victorian novelist. Through Dickens's diaries, correspondence, address books, and photographs, Tomalin is able to reconstruct the relationship between Charles and Nelly, bringing it to vivid life.

All the smaller birds flew backward into the sea, and that is why there are no songbirds on Joya. Only huge, ragged ravens. I&#x2019;d watch them perch on the rooftops like omens, and try to squint them into the chaffinches and goldcrests Da drew from memory. If I imagined hard enough, I could almost hear them singing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did the songbirds leave, Da?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they could, Isabella.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And the wolves? The deer?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da&#x2019;s face would darken. &#x201c;Seems the sea was better than what they were running from.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da would tell me another story then, about the girl-warrior Arinta, or Joya&#x2019;s mythical past as a floating island, and refuse to say more about the wolves and the backward birds. But I kept asking, until the day came when I found my own answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The morning it began was like any other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke in my narrow bed, sunrise just starting to brighten the mud walls of my room. The smell of burnt porridge hung on the air. Da must have been up for hours, as it took a long time for the fire to heat the heavy clay pot. I could hear Miss La, our hen, scratching about outside my room, seeking out crumbs. She was twelve years old, same as me, but even though it&#x2019;s young for a person, it&#x2019;s very, very old for a chicken. Her feathers were gray, her mood was black, and even our cat, Pep, was scared of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My tummy rumbled as I stretched out my arms. Pep was sprawled across my legs, and he yowled loudly as I sat up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You awake, Isabella?&#x201d; Da called from the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Porridge is ready. A little overready, in fact . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; I eased my legs out and smoothed the cat&#x2019;s rough fur where it had ruffled in the night. &#x201c;Sorry, Pep.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He purred and closed his green eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I washed my face in the basin by the window and stuck a tongue out at the reflection in the polished metal above Gabo&#x2019;s bed. I straightened his sheets, dustier every day but still made, and traced the voice line arched next to his pillow--a long, thin hollow Da had etched for us up the walls and over the ceiling. When we pressed our lips to it and whispered, it carried our voices so we could talk even when we were at each end of the room in our separate beds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three years now. Three years since I sat there, my twin&#x2019;s hand fire in mine as he faded in the night, fast as a blown-out match.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But still I could conjure him. Easy as breathing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would not do to start the day sad. Shaking the thoughts out of my head, I pulled on my school dress instead. It was as big as it had been six weeks before. My best friend, Lupe, would laugh. Still the shortest in the class! she&#x2019;d say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I quickly braided my unbrushed hair and hoped Da wouldn&#x2019;t notice I hadn&#x2019;t untangled it all summer. Pep was rolling on the bed, but I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to stroke him with my uniform on. My teacher, Se�ora Feliz, was always picking ginger hairs off my dress with irritated fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pulled aside the curtain that served as my bedroom door and carefully stepped over Miss La, who squawked as I scattered her small pile of crumbs. She narrowed her misty eyes and pecked at my ankles, chasing me farther into the main room, where we ate, talked, and planned adventures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A big bowl of blackened porridge sat on our large pine-plank table, marooned among a sea of maps. More of Da&#x2019;s maps were stuck to the walls, and they rustled as I passed, like a talking breeze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I traced the papers with my finger, as I did every morning, watching how the silver pigment of Afrik&#x2019;s rivers met those of �ygpt, how �ygpt clung to the curve of Europa Bay like one hand grasping another across the sea. On the opposite wall hung the sketchy coast of Amrica and its dragging ocean currents, labeled with strange, wondrous names: the Frozen Circle, the Vanishing Triangle, the Cerulean Sea. The paper was dyed a beautiful deep blue, and the currents were picked out in thread against it. Da had used a needle and thread thin as a hair for these: gold for Cerulean, black for the Triangle, white for the Frozen Circle. But past the eastern coast, everything stopped. Only one word broke the blankness:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Incognito. Unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could almost feel Da&#x2019;s disappointment in the long-dried ink of the word. Unfavorable tides on his last trip had meant an early return to Joya, and Da never again made it across that wild expanse before the Governor arrived on our island. Governor Adori closed the ports and made the forest that stretched coast to coast between our village of Gromera and the rest of the island into a border, banishing anyone who resisted his rule to the other side. Gromera was cut off from the rest of Joya, and the forest was strung with thick thorns and enormous bells to warn the Governor&#x2019;s guards if anyone came through. I had never heard the bells ring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I knew Da dreamt of filling in the gaps on his Amrica maps, whereas what I wanted, more than anything else, was to cross the forest border and chart the Forgotten Territories, which lay beyond, though I had never told him so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was only one map that showed the whole of our island, and it hung in Da&#x2019;s study. I called it Ma&#x2019;s map because it had been passed down through her family for generations, maybe even as far back as Arinta&#x2019;s time a thousand years ago. It had always felt like a sign that Ma and Da were meant for each other, that he was a cartographer and her only heirloom was a map.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each of us carries the map of our lives on our skin, in the way we walk, even the way we grow, Da would often say. See here how my blood runs not blue at my wrist, but black? Your mother always said it was ink. I am a cartographer through to my heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fetch the jug, would you?&#x201d; Da&#x2019;s voice made me jump, pulling me back into the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I dragged a chair to the shelves, carefully taking the jug from high up, and put it on the table next to the porridge. It was forest green and special because it was the last thing Ma had made. We used it only on the first and last days of school, or birthdays and feast days. Da kept it out of reach and washed it with great care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could remember Ma sometimes--dark-eyed and mostly smiling, smelling of the black clay she worked with, making pots for the villagers and delicate pieces for the Governor. Or maybe I imagined her, like the songbirds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, little one.&#x201d; Da limped from the kitchen. I rushed to take the milk pail and cups he was carrying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t walk without your stick,&#x201d; I scolded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da had broken his leg as a young man, leaping from the jetty of an �ygptian port onto a moving ship that was leaving for Amrica without him, and now used a walking stick carved from a fragment of his great-grandfather&#x2019;s fishing boat. It was my favorite thing out of the many favorite things in the room. Light as paper, it floated in even the thinnest skim of water, but most miraculous of all, it glowed in the dark. Da said it was because of the sap, but I knew it was magic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hurried to clear a space on the table, shifting the Himalay Mountains onto a shelf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da poured the milk into Ma&#x2019;s jug, then settled down on the bench next to me and grinned. &#x201c;Pick a pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Left.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wiggled his eyebrows like two black caterpillars. &#x201c;Right answer.&#x201d; He pulled a small jar from his pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Pine honey!&#x201d; I unscrewed the lid, and the smell filled my nostrils, making my mouth water. &#x201c;Thank you, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing but the best for your first day back at school.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only school. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, well, I suppose I&#x2019;ll just have to eat all of this myself, then. . . .&#x201d; He took the open jar and mimed pouring the honey into his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I grabbed it back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, it&#x2019;s a very important day. I&#x2019;m only surprised you didn&#x2019;t get two jars.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The honey was so good I hardly noticed the porridge was burnt, but when I looked up, Da&#x2019;s food was untouched. He was sitting in that hunched way that meant he was thinking. His hand rested on the milk jug, and I could see the pulse in his wrist. His eyes had a faraway look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First days of school were hard for both of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cleared away my bowl as quietly as I could and pushed his closer to his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you later, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he didn&#x2019;t answer, I picked up my satchel and left the house, closing the peeling green door gently behind me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our street ran in a straight, steep line down to the Western Sea, and all the houses were built the same, a long row of mud huts with straw roofs that Lupe thought looked sweet. I thought that they looked as if one good gust of wind would send them all tumbling into the sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I normally ran to the market square, skidding downhill on my heels, because the ravens liked to fly low and running put them off. Today, though, I settled into a fast walk--after all, I was almost at the top of the school now. It didn&#x2019;t seem right to run like a little child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Masha, who lived across the street, was standing in her doorway. I waved, trying to see past her into the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Looking for someone?&#x201d; She smiled, her lined face crinkling like old paper. &#x201c;Pablo&#x2019;s already left. You know the Governor likes them to be at work before dawn.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Masha&#x2019;s son, Pablo, had been born when she was already old, her belly swelling even as her hair turned gray and her face creased with age. Masha had called it a miracle, and Pablo was miraculous. Gabo and I had always been in awe of him, as all the villagers were, because of his strength. At age ten, he could lift his parents, one over each shoulder. Having a piggyback from Pablo felt like flying, but it had been a long time since I&#x2019;d seen him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two years ago, when his mother&#x2019;s back got too bad, Pablo left school and took her place as a laborer, although Masha pleaded with him not to. Now fourteen, he pulled carts as if they were paper, and cared for the Governor&#x2019;s horses too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He took the present for Lupe,&#x201d; Masha added, wrinkling her nose. I knew she didn&#x2019;t understand why I chose to be friends with the Governor&#x2019;s daughter. &#x201c;I told him to hide it like you asked.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll see him tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; But her voice was not hopeful. He was always up before sunrise, home after dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waved good-bye, shouldered my satchel, and started down the hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From this high up, Gromera looked like a wheel, or a starburst, with the market square at its center and streets like spokes spiking outward, some ending at the wide, calm harbor that bottlenecked into the sea, ripe with fish. On a clear night, the stars settled on its surface like water lilies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Governor&#x2019;s ship was moored there, as always. Da said it was carved from a single Afrik baobab trunk. The baobab must be an enormous tree because the hull nearly spanned the width of the port, the mast arrowing toward the sky, the sails stowed. It crouched over the fishing fleet like a mountain, huge and unmoving. Like everything the Governor had, it took up far more space than it ought to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To the east, his house glinted in the sunrise. Built from black basalt and big as five ships, the mansion sat between the blue sea and the green forest, spreading out over the fields like a storm cloud. From here, though, it looked small enough to squash between my forefinger and thumb. Below it was the village, with the school halfway between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old school building had been small but bright, and we had painted the walls rainbow colors with whatever dyes Da could spare. But then the Governor had knocked it down--Lupe had decided she&#x2019;d had enough of being taught alone at home and demanded to be sent to the local school like the rest of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Governor Adori had rebuilt it from stone, twice as big, because if his daughter was going, it had to look grander.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for me, you understand,&#x201d; said Lupe with a sad smile. She adopted an even posher voice to add, &#x201c;To uphold the family honor.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t allowed to paint the walls of the new school. A lot of children were unkind to Lupe because of that, but I knew it wasn&#x2019;t her fault.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the Governor&#x2019;s house, closest to the forest, were the orchards, where I had never been. I squinted at the antlike specks of the laborers there and wondered which one was Pablo. To the west, the black sand of the beaches was almost covered by the incoming tide. We were not permitted to be on the beaches at high tide, and no one was allowed in the sea unless they were launching one of the Governor&#x2019;s boats. My toes itched. Da had described being in the sea, but it was not the same as trying it for myself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above the beaches were the clay mines, which I tried not to look at because it brought back one of the few clear memories I had of Ma--the day she took Gabo and me to the mines. She taught us how to tie ourselves with vines to a dragon tree--You knot like this, and then rub the sap into your hands for grip--and lowered us one by one into the gorge. Gabo got scared and wriggled so much the knot broke.

Alex is a member of the Latino Blood, but he wishes he could leave gang life and pursue a college career. The plot thickens as Alex accepts a bet from a friend that he cannot bed Brittany by Thanksgiving. Smoldering doesn't quite do justice to the romantic banter that sparks between them. As the story unfolds, Alex is incarcerated and later hospitalized. Raw language and Spanish phrases that Anglo readers might feel obligated to investigate further are peppered throughout.

He tries to look at the four presidential heads as an archaeologist might millennia in the future. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Former <i>Newsweek</i> editor John Taliaferro calls Mount Rushmore "one of the nation's most luminescent beacons of democracy," ranking up there with the Liberty Bell and the Statue of Liberty. Yet comparatively little is known about its remarkable genesis. Taliaferro wryly notes that pop singer Cher "honestly believed that the sculpture was a natural formation." He tells the story of how Rushmore was conceived and built, and why controversy surrounded the project from the start. <i>Great White Fathers</i> is about the meaning of public art, the rise of automobile tourism, and the development of kitsch culture. At its center is Rushmore's feisty sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who waged an energetic campaign on behalf of his artistic vision and then carved the faces of four presidents into a mountainside. Taliaferro discusses every conceivable aspect of the monument, from the filming of Alfred Hitchcock's <i>North by Northwest</i> (a minor hullabaloo) to the Native American activists who have threatened it (a more significant one) to recent suggestions by conservatives that Ronald Reagan's image be added (not yet one only because it hasn't approached reality). <i>Great White Fathers</i> is an engaging blend of travelogue and history; vacationers willing to spend umpteen hours driving all the way to the Black Hills of South Dakota would be wise also to invest a few in this fascinating book. <i>--John J.

Trevor Noah is one of the comedy world&#39;s brightest new voices, a light-footed but sharp-minded observer of the absurdities of politics, race and identity, sharing jokes and insights drawn from the wealth of experience acquired in his relatively young life. As host of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, he provides viewers in America and around the globe with their nightly dose of biting satire, but here Noah turns his focus inward, giving readers a deeply personal, heartfelt and humorous look at the world that shaped him. Noah was born a crime, the son of a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother, at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents&#39; indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the first years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, take him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa&#39;s white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. A collection of eighteen personal essays, Born a Crime tells the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. Born a Crime is equally the story of that young man&#39;s fearless, rebellious and fervently religious mother - a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence and abuse that ultimately threatens her own life. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Noah illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and an unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a lovable delinquent making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed with only a keen sense of humour and a mother&#39;s unconventional, unconditional love.</p><p><b>An engaging, fast-paced and vivid read . . .

Now think of the halfway mark in that event -- the halftime, the intermission -- when everyone takes a breather and wonders the same thing: What's going to happen in the second half?<br><br>We have a similar point in our lives, often around our fiftieth birthday, when we begin to wonder about our second half. If you're at or approaching that age, you probably think about how much money you're going to need so you can have the kind of life you want. Charles Schwab, bestselling author of <i>Charles Schwab's Guide to Financial Independence</i>, offers you advice and support for getting there.<br><br>For more than twenty-five years, Charles Schwab has been passionate about demystifying investing.

He takes you step-by-step through a process that will enable you to see where you are financially today and where you want to get so that the second half of your life can be as fulfilling as you hope. <br><br>One hundred percent of the author's profits from this book will be donated to a charity that benefits seniors through The Charles Schwab Corporation Foundation.<br><br><i>Dear Reader,<br>We have a point in our lives when we find ourselves wondering about the second half. The age differs from person to person. For some it comes in their late forties, for others it's in their early fifties. When we reach that age, we feel different. We may sense a change coming and we want to pause and to think about what we've accomplished and what we still hope to do.<br>So what does this have to do with investing?<br><br>A lot. A sound investing strategy is what gives you the means and the courage to do what you want. The issues may seem daunting. But it can be done. It has to be done, because while getting older isn't a bad thing, being unprepared for it is. And by not understanding the financial part of your future, you sabotage yourself and you limit your choices.<br><br>Start today, maybe even right now. Take control of the second half of your life. Dream about it, wonder about it, think boldly about what you want. And take the first step, which is usually the hardest. Once you get started, the satisfaction you feel will keep you going. But don't delay in your preparations. The best is yet to come. <br><br>Charles R. Schwab<br>from the prologue </i></p><p>As boomers reach midlife faster than a new Beatles CD can climb the charts, many are wondering if they'll have sufficient resources to comfortably make it through their golden years. Investment guru Charles Schwab's <i>You're Fifty--Now What?</i> addresses these concerns with a step-by-step road map to help the middle-aged assess where they're at, determine where they want to go, and pick the proper mix of investments to get there. "While getting older isn't a bad thing," Schwab writes, "being unprepared for it is. And by not understanding the financial part of your future, you sabotage yourself and limit your choices." Not surprisingly--given the author's background as founder of the discount brokerage that bears his name--the book contends that you have to remain an active investor for the rest of your life in order to make it financially over the long haul. To do so, it advocates using as aggressive an approach as you can comfortably handle, centered on a combination of broad-based index funds and actively managed mutual funds or individual stocks. <p> With plenty of easy-to-use worksheets, Schwab helps you take stock of everything you've accumulated, determine how much it costs you to live now, and estimate what it will take to maintain that lifestyle into the future. The latter is determined by calculating everything from projected housing and tax obligations to food and entertainment expenses, while life-expectancy tables, inflation adjustment factors, and investment return rates allow you to see where you stand versus where you need to be. Schwab then addresses reaching these goals through a proper investment mix. (Sidebars explaining the basics guide even novices through these critical steps.) Additional chapters detail ways to develop a regular long-term cash flow, and suggest how to monitor its progress while making adjustments when necessary. There is also information on financial advisors, insurance, estate plans, and charitable giving, adding up to a wealth of specifics presented in a manner that virtually everyone should be able to understand and follow. <i>--Howard Rothman</i></p>&#x201c;In <b>You&#x2019;re Fifty&#x2014;Now What?</b> author Charles R.

From early childhood through their twenties, they spoke only to each other in a secret langauge, building an elaborate fantasy life. Then, from their self-imposed isolation, they were catapulted into the hormonal havoc of adolescence, plunging into a wild spree that led to their incarceration in a hospital for the criminally insane. A profoundly powerful and moving story.</p><p>Marjorie Wallace is an award-winning journalist, author, playwright and broadcaster, and has won nine major awards for her journalism, books and plays. She is currently Chief Executive of SANE, the mental health charity, which she helped to found. Marjorie Wallace (Countess Skarbeck) is married and lives in London with her three sons, Sacha, Stefan and Justin, and daughter, Sophia Augusta.This true story focuses on the young adult years of identical twin girls. June and Jennifer isolate themselves from family and society, sinking into a world of interdependency, fantasy, and obsessive game-playing, until an arson spree lands them in a hospital for the criminally insane. The fascination of this tale lies in the discrepancy between the twins' silent, emotionless facade and the rich creativity and passion that spills out endlessly in their writing. The author has reconstructed their story from their extensive diaries, in which they compulsively explore their lives and the condition of the world as they perceive it. Again and again, they express both their love and hatred for each other and their desire yet inability to become separate individuals. This book is written by a sympathetic journalist for a general audience.Amy D.

She has a B.A. from Yale University. She serves as Assistant Rabbi at Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles, where she lives with her family."Rabbi Rachel Tinoner has given us a wonderful little book. In easy but deceptively profound language, she deftly savors the essential unknowability of God, the ubiquity of Torah and the mystery of redemption.

This attention to the complexity and detail of the Torah means that these books are not always fascinating reading; nor do they supply a rabbinical commentary like that found in Joel L.

While he viewed slavery as a moral crime abhorrent to American principles, he disapproved of anti-slavery activists. Until the last year of his life, he advocated "voluntary deportation," concerned that free blacks in a white society would result in centuries of conflict. In 1861, he had reluctantly taken the nation to war to save it. While this devastating struggle would preserve the Union, it would also abolish slavery&#x2014;creating the biracial democracy Lincoln feared. John Quincy Adams, forty years earlier, was convinced that only a civil war would end slavery and preserve the Union. An antislavery activist, he had concluded that a multiracial America was inevitable. </p><p><em>Lincoln and the Abolitionists</em>, a frank look at Lincoln, "warts and all," provides an in-depth look at how these two presidents came to see the issues of slavery and race, and how that understanding shaped their perspectives. In a far-reaching historical narrative, Fred Kaplan offers a nuanced appreciation of both these great men and the events that have characterized race relations in America for more than a century&#x2014;a legacy that continues to haunt us all. </p><p>The book has a colorful supporting cast from the relatively obscure Dorcas Allen, Moses Parsons, Violet Parsons, Theophilus Parsons, Phoebe Adams, John King, Charles Fenton Mercer, Phillip Doddridge, David Walker, Usher F. Linder, and H. Ford Douglas to Elijah Lovejoy, Francis Scott Key, William Channing, Wendell Phillips, and Rufus King. The cast includes Hannibal Hamlin, Lincoln&#x2019;s first vice president, and James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson, the two presidents on either side of Lincoln. And it includes Abigail Adams, John Adams, Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and Frederick Douglass, who hold honored places in the American historical memory.</p><p>The subject of this book is slavery and racism, the paradox of Lincoln, our greatest president, as an antislavery moralist who believed in an exclusively white America; and Adams, our most brilliant statesman, as an antislavery activist who had no doubt that the United States would become a multiracial nation. It is as much about the present as the past.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Fred Kaplan is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

She spins round with her hippo, blows bubbles in the bath with giraffe, and picnics on brown bread and honey with her bear when it's sunny. And, did you ever meet a leopard in top hat and tail? He's simply the best, as anyone can see. It's the most delightful menagerie imaginable, and the sweetest story--with a little twist at the end.<br></p><p>A spunky preschooler proves she's learned an important life lesson: it's who you know that counts. "I know a Rhino/ We like to take tea," she informs readers, as the huge horned beast daintily pours out a pot and a tiny stool collapses beneath his weight. "I have two sugars/ and Rhino has three." The seven other animals making up her unusual circle include an illness-prone dragon and a leopard with a penchant for formal wear. What's more, as the narrator reveals in the final page, the members of this motley menagerie aren't mere acquaintances; all of them "live with me!" (as beloved stuffed toys that the girl snuggles with as she sleeps). While not quite up to the unfettered goofiness of his Sometimes I Like to Curl Up Like a Ball, Fuge still conveys humor and good cheer with full-bleed spreads that capitalize on the animals' various attributes (one turns vertical when the girl introduces a bubble-bath loving giraffe). He furnishes the stage-like scenes with minimal bright, monochromatic backdrops, keeping the focus on the animal guests' often overwhelming size and elaborate texture. Rhino's portrait, for example, emphasizes the folds of ample flesh that hang over its ribs. Preschoolers will delight in the zoologically incorrect situations put forth by the pert heroine. Ages 3-6.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreS. This vivid rhyming picture book captures a child at imaginary play. It begins: "I know a rhino. / We like to take tea. / I have two sugars / and rhino has three," and the lovely picture shows a gigantic rhinoceros sharing a child-size table and chairs with a little girl. He has his legs crossed, and he pours the tea with perfect manners for a perfect tea party. The text continues in the same vein as the little girl plays in the mud with a pig, dances with an orangutan, twirls with a hippo, acts as vet for a sick dragon, bathes with a giraffe, picnics with a bear, and plays dress-up with a leopard. The scenarios are all bright fun, and the ending is particularly satisfying as the child curls up in bed with her toy animal friends. This will be a nice read-aloud for young children; the large print and easy poetry will also entice brand-new readers to try the pages on their own. <i>Kathy Broderick</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has published over 90 books including: The English Language (Penguin), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, and The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English language. He was awarded the OBE for services to the English language in 1995.*Starred Review* For at least 200 years, the story of English has been the story of Standard English triumphant. But now, in a work of unprecedented scope and range, a distinguished linguist challenges that deceptive hegemony, showing with piquant detail and lively anecdote that no standards of correctness have ever really contained the surging energy of English, in all it multiform varieties. From the syntactical inventiveness of tenth-century Norse invaders to the lexical ecumenism of twenty-first-century Tex-Mex ranch hands, Crystal traces the diverse and unpredictable influences that have shaped English into an unruly family of dialects, creoles, and patois. To be sure, Crystal acknowledges the emergence during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of a prestigious standard version of English. Yet he shows in instance after instance that the tempests of linguistic change have often overwhelmed the custodians of the King's English, compelling them to accommodate forces they could not control. And though he never loses his focus on language, Crystal allows some of its more colorful users--including Chaucer, Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Jefferson--to bring their personalities and voices into the chronicle. Accessible to the nonspecialist, Crystal's rich chronicle still presses deeply enough into key episodes (the Great Vowel Shift and the Elizabethan effervescence, for instance) to entice even casual readers into the more scholarly sources listed at the end of the book.

Writing with an expert practitioner's appreciation for music, Bragg tells the story of British rock-'n'-roll's forerunner with verve and great intelligence."<br><b><i>&#x2015; Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</i></b><br>Skiffle -- a "do-it-yourself music craze with American jazz, blues, folk, and roots influences - is a story of jazz pilgrims and blues blowers, Teddy Boys and beatnik girls, coffee-bar bohemians and refugees from the McCarthyite witch hunts. Skiffle is reason the guitar came to the forefront of music in the UK and led directly to the British Invasion of the US charts in the 1960s.<br>Emerging from the trad-jazz clubs of the early '50s, skiffle was adopted by the first generation of British "teenagers" &#x2015; working class kids who grew up during the dreary, post-war rationing years. Before Skiffle, the pop culture was dominated by crooners and mediated by a stuffy BBC. Lonnie Donegan hit the charts in 1956 with a version of Lead Belly's "Rock Island Line" and soon sales of guitars rocketed from 5,000 to 250,000 a year.<br>Like punk rock that would flourish two decades later, skiffle was home grown: all you needed were three guitar chords and you could form a group, with mates playing tea-chest bass and washboard as a rhythm section.<br>ROOTS, RADICALS AND ROCKERS is the first book to explore the Skiffle phenomenon in depth &#x2015; Billy Bragg'fs meticulously researched and joyous account shows how Skiffle sparked a revolution that shaped pop music as we have come to know it.</p><p><b>Stephen William "Billy" Bragg</b> is an English singer-songwriter and left-wing activist.

Long buried and suppressed, the Gnostic Gospels contain the secret writings attributed to the followers of Jesus.In 1945 fifty-two papyrus texts, including gospels and other secret documents, were found concealed in an earthenware jar buried in the Egyptian desert. These so-called Gnostic writings were Coptic translations from the original Greek dating from the time of the New Testament. The material they embodied - poems, quasi-philosophical descriptions of the origins of the universe, myths, magic and instructions for mystic practice - were later declared heretical, as they offered a powerful alternative to the Orthodox Christian tradition. In a book that is as exciting as it is scholarly, Elaine Pagels examines these texts and the questions they pose and shows why Gnosticism was eventually stamped out by the increasingly organised and institutionalised Orthodox Church.</p><p>Gnosticism's Christian form grew to prominence in the 2nd century A.D. Ultimately denounced as heretical by the early church, Gnosticism proposed a revealed knowledge of God ("gnosis" meaning "knowledge" in Greek), held as a secret tradition of the apostles. In <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i>, author Elaine Pagels suggests that Christianity could have developed quite differently if Gnostic texts had become part of the Christian canon. Without a doubt: Gnosticism celebrates God as both Mother and Father, shows a very human Jesus's relationship to Mary Magdalene, suggests the Resurrection is better understood symbolically, and speaks to self-knowledge as the route to union with God. Pagels argues that Christian orthodoxy grew out of the political considerations of the day, serving to legitimize and consolidate early church leadership. Her contrast of that developing orthodoxy with Gnostic teachings presents an intriguing trajectory on a world faith as it "might have become." <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> provides engaging reading for those seeking a broader perspective on the early development of Christianity. <i>--F.

When I read this, I could not put it down. I even ordered extra copies of this book, and gave them as gifts to a few of my buddies. Alhough this review is written from a man's perspective, the content pertains to both sexes. The content of this book is on a mature level, with an audience reaching the 25+ age bracket. I recommend it for people who have been out of college for a few years and have discerned a vocation to the marriage covenant. This book is definitely not for John Q. Public who is looking to take someone home from a bar on Friday night. A large part of what Fr. Morrow touches on is that our culture really needs to change. Sadly, pre-marital sex has become much of the norm, and too many people decide to become a "couple" after the 2nd or 3rd date. This had led to not only quite a bit of heartbreak, but also a serious lack of trust in others. Our society has become a "friends with benefits" world, which has led to a breakdown in the "sanctity of marriage" and the marriage covenant. A lot of the "heartbreak" associated with secular dating today has been destroyed due to pre-marital sex. Lovemaking should only take place within the sanctity of marriage, and the marital embrace shall always be open to life. The best courtship is a chaste and honorable courtship. Sadly, many men (I can pick on men, I am one) have forgotten how to do this. What I liked best about this book is Fr. Morrow suggests doing some "friendship dating" for at least one to three months before making a "commitment" to someone. It is fun to take a young lady to an art museum, send her flowers, write her letters, or go for long walks in the park. Attending Mass together and praying together are wonderful things to do too. Fr. Morrow also throws in some ideas for some good "cheap dates" that are not only fun, but also creative. Fr. Morrow touches quite a bit on formation (before finding Miss Right, you need to be Mr. Right), questions to ask, and conversations to have during the courtship process. There is also an excellent chapter written on modesty and communication. Fr. Morrow gives some insights on places to go to meet a prospective spouse, such as Catholic seminars and pro-life events. However, he stresses that people go because you are interested in participating in a cause or hearing a lecture, not just finding someone to go to a movie with Saturday night. As a never married Catholic man in my mid 30's, (I was in my late 20's when I "returned" to the faith, and began to learn more about it), I find that there are quite a few single Catholic women who are looking for a Catholic man to step up to the plate. Many devout Catholic men have not taken enough initative in this area, and I think that is one reason why quite a few Catholic women are marrying men outside of their faith. Another reason I think alot of Catholic women have been marrying outside their faith is they find that there are several "Catholic" men out there who are not truly Catholic, and do not meet their expectations. Catholic men, I urge you to learn your faith well and practice it. If you are called to marriage, please take some initiative in finding good Catholic spoouses. They are out there. Don't give up. I have met several nice and authentic Catholic women over the past few years who are not only highly intelligent, fun, well-educated, smart, committed to their faith, but also very beautiful inside and outside. I appreciate the work Fr. Morrow did in putting this work together, and he holds firmly to his beliefs and those of the Holy Catholic Church. The orthodoxy is here, and the Catholic Faith is Alive!! --D. McSherry<br><br> --P. Collins<br><br>This is the map for the Christian counterrevolution on matters sexual. It is a book that any parent, any single, any grandparent, and any educator should have. And certainly pastors should read it and preach it. The book is specific and answers specifically the age-old question of how much physical contact is prudent in a Christian courtship (of course, no sex, but even restraint in kissing). Fr. Morrow advocates a two-stage process: first non-exclusive friendship dating with no kissing or even hand-holding, only nice hugs. If the two "friends" find that they have a mutual interest in exploring the possibility of marriage, they then agree to enter the courtship period where gentle and restrained kissing and hand-holding are allowed. The goal is to create and deepen personal intimacy and not short circuit the growth of genuine friendship with inappropriate physical intimacy. Certainly, many of us who are now married wish we would have had this type of book in hand years ago. It would have saved many a lot of needless confusion and trouble. You can find a more detailed review at my blog. --Oswald Sobrino<br><br>I agree with an earlier review that the subject matter is for mature audiences, but I believe that with the bombardment of sexual messages in our culture that this is appropriate for older teens who are eager to "date" and have boyfriends or girlfriends. It is really almost too late once they leave for college to have a strong influence. This is the type of book that my mother would have read first and then given to me for reading and later discussion during my teen years. I think that it could open lines of communication between a teen and a parent of the same gender. If responsible adults won't provide the answers to their questions then teens will ask each other or turn elsewhere for information. I was surprised that this book actually tackled some very specific issues that teens in my parish high school program have brought up in (single sex) discussion groups such as what the church teaches is appropriate in marital relations and before marriage. --P. Collins</p><h2>Basho&#39;s Journey: The Literary Prose Of Matsuo Basho</h2><p><i>Offers the most comprehensive collection of Basho's prose available, beautifully translated into English.</i><br><br>In Basho's Journey, David Landis Barnhill provides the definitive translation of Matsuo Basho's literary prose, as well as a companion piece to his previous translation, Basho's Haiku. One of the world's greatest nature writers, Basho (1644&#x2013;1694) is well known for his subtle sensitivity to the natural world, and his writings have influenced contemporary American environmental writers such as Gretel Ehrlich, John Elder, and Gary Snyder. This volume concentrates on Basho's travel journal, literary diary (Saga Diary), and haibun. The premiere form of literary prose in medieval Japan, the travel journal described the uncertainty and occasional humor of traveling, appreciations of nature, and encounters with areas rich in cultural history. Haiku poetry often accompanied the prose. The literary diary also had a long history, with a format similar to the travel journal but with a focus on the place where the poet was living. Basho was the first master of haibun, short poetic prose sketches that usually included haiku.<br><br>As he did in Basho's Haiku, Barnhill arranges the work chronologically in order to show Basho's development as a writer. These accessible translations capture the spirit of the original Japanese prose, permitting the nature images to hint at the deeper meaning in the work. Barnhill's introduction presents an overview of Basho's prose and discusses the significance of nature in this literary form, while also noting Basho's significance to contemporary American literature and environmental thought. Excellent notes clearly annotate the translations.</p><p><p>David Landis Barnhill is Director of Environmental Studies and Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh. He is the translator of Basho's Haiku: Selected Poems of Matsuo Basho and the coeditor (with Roger S. Gottlieb) of Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground, both also published by SUNY Press.</p>&#x201c;Barnhill&#x2019;s approach to translation is straightforward and unfussy, aiming to be as accurate as possible, making his two volumes a highly serviceable compilation. They will be of great value to readers.&#x201d; &#x2015; The Japan Times<br><br>"Read cover to cover, the volume presents the breadth of Basho&#x2019;s prose. If you open it randomly, on almost every page you encounter haunting images of the landscape, village life, and literary culture of Japan. This book inspires us to stop and pay attention to the poetry of the world around us." &#x2015; Buddhadharma<br><br>&#x201c;...Barnhill reveals the importance of narrative and social contexts in reading Basho. Barnhill&#x2019;s careful translations and notes reveal a poet both independent and pious ... Above all, Basho&#x2019;s experience of &#x2018;cultured nature&#x2019; emerges unforgettably.&#x201d; &#x2015; The Providence Sunday Journal on Basho&#x2019;s Journey and Basho&#x2019;s Haiku<br><br>"Barnhill's translations maintain the Japanese originals' direct sparseness, and retain their dramatic sequence, which all too many translations unfortunately and unnecessarily sacrifice." &#x2015; Taigen Dan Leighton, cotranslator of Dogen's Pure Standards for the Zen Community: A Translation of Eihei Shingi</p><h2>Black Gods of the Asphalt: Religion, Hip-Hop, and Street Basketball</h2><p>J-Rod moves like a small tank on the court, his face mean, staring down his opponents. "I play just like my father," he says. "Before my father died, he was a problem on the court. I'm a problem." Playing basketball for him fuses past and present, conjuring his father's memory into a force that opponents can feel in each bone-snapping drive to the basket. <br><br>On the street, every ballplayer has a story. Onaje X. O. Woodbine, a former streetball player who became an all-star Ivy Leaguer, brings the sights and sounds, hopes and dreams of street basketball to life. He shows that big games have a trickster figure and a master of black talk whose commentary interprets the game for audiences. The beats of hip-hop and reggae make up the soundtrack, and the ballplayers are half-men, half-heroes, defying the ghetto's limitations with their flights to the basket.<br><br>Basketball is popular among young black American men but not because, as many claim, they are "pushed by poverty" or "pulled" by white institutions to play it. Black men choose to participate in basketball because of the transcendent experience of the game. Through interviews with and observations of urban basketball players, Onaje X. O. Woodbine composes a rare portrait of a passionate, committed, and resilient group of athletes who use the court to mine what urban life cannot corrupt. If people turn to religion to reimagine their place in the world, then black streetball players are indeed the hierophants of the asphalt.</p><p>Basketball is popular among young black American men, but not because, as many claim, they are &#34;pushed by poverty&#34; or &#34;pulled&#34; by white institutions to play it.

Vincent Cianni spent eight years photographing and documenting a group of Latino in-line skaters in the Southside of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Cianni weaves together images of the skaters with their own words, showing the skaters' struggles to find a place to skate and build skate parks, and just to survive in the city. In the evacuated industrial spaces of their neighborhood, the skaters carve out places for enjoying their sport and showing off their skills&#x2014;often thwarting established rules and authority figures in the process. Their stories are both personal and resonant; they reflect the trials and tenacity of a young urban culture, as well as life in Southside's Latino community.</p> <p><em>We Skate Hardcore</em>, with its verve and youthful energy, will especially appeal to photographers, those interested in urban studies and adolescence, New Yorkers, and in-line skaters and extreme sports enthusiasts everywhere.</p></p><p><p><b>Vincent Cianni</b> began photographing the Southside of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1994.

"[The bride] and the groom both look as though there were sunlight behind their eyes, as though their mouths irresistibly turned to smiles," wrote Emily Post in 1922's <i>Etiquette</i>. Great-granddaughter-in-law Peggy Post, author of the fourth edition of <i>Emily Post's Wedding Etiquette</i>, absolutely agrees with Miss Emily. To ensure those bright eyes and smiles, she imparts thoughtful and commonsensical advice on how to plan for not just your wedding, but for all the social and familial obligations and traditions that a wedding entails.<p> Unlike many wedding manuals, Post includes advice for the "encore" bride as well as for the new bride. In this day of remarriages and blended families, tact and strategy are often needed to make sure feelings aren't hurt and everything runs as smoothly as possible. A chapter on multicultural and interfaith marriages addresses differing world traditions and how they can be incorporated into a touching ceremony that makes both the couple and their families happy. If you are unsure of who is supposed to do what, Post gives you clear instruction, often including a flow chart that delineates the responsibilities of all people involved in the wedding party (bride's parents throw the engagement party, best man returns the tuxes, flower girl's family pays for her outfit).</p><p> Throughout <i>Emily Post's Wedding Etiquette</i> are sidebars with questions asked of Post regarding an amazing array of wedding-related conundrums ("My daughter's fianc� wants to follow his family's tradition of having a money tree at the wedding. I personally find this distasteful; can I say so?"). This is a great book to find the answers for all those sticky questions. All involved in the wedding process should leaf through, get their bearings, smile, and then forge ahead. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i></p>Peggy Post represents the third generation of Post authors, the recognized authorities on etiquette.Peggy has provided etiquette advice to some of America's top corporations, drawing on a thirty-year career that has included work in the travel, banking, and relocation management industries.She writes monthly etiquette columns in <i>Good Housekeeping</i> and <i>Parents,</i> and has appeared on syndicated programs, including <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America,</i> and <i>Today;</i> and in hundreds of newspapers and radio stations across the country.She is married to Emily's great-grandson Allen, and the couple resides in Florida. <p></p></p><h2>Zero Minus Ten</h2><p><p><b>In ten days, Hong Kong will pass into the hands of the Chinese&#x2014;and 007 is on his way there to undertake his most dangerous and thrilling mission yet.</b></p><p></p><p>In the Australian desert, a nuclear bomb explodes.

Dispatched to Hong Kong to halt a series of violent incidents that threaten the Crown Colony's mid-1997 return to the People's Republic of China, Bond first checks on Guy Thackeray, the fifth- generation head of a family shipping firm called EurAsia Enterprises. Although the SIS troubleshooter gets the goods on the shady businessman, the latter perishes (or appears to) in a car bombing.

Against the odds, the master spy penetrates the PRC and returns alive, bearing papers that put Li in his debt. With help from the grateful crime boss, Bond heads down under to investigate a mysterious outback blast London has told him is not his affair. In due course, he finds a back-from- the-dead Thackeray at a remote uranium mine; to his horror, he learns that the embittered taipan (who's used EurAsia to make a great fortune in the drug trade) plans to put paid to the celebration of Hong Kong's handover by detonating a crude nuclear device on or near the island at midnight on June 30, 1997.

She knows that the violent deaths of the last Master and Chalice have thrown Willowlands into turmoil; but she is only a beekeeper, and the problems of the Circle that govern Willowlands have nothing to do with her&#x2014;although she wonders what will become of her demesne, because the Master and Chalice left no heirs to carry on their crucial duties. <br><br> And then the Circle come to Mirasol, to tell her that she has been chosen to be the new Chalice; and the Master she must learn to work with is a Priest of Fire, a man no longer quite human, whose touch can burn human flesh to the bone.</p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>.

She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.<p></p>Grade 9 Up&#x2014;The demesne of Willowlands is in a state of upheaval&#x2014;great fissures in the earth have opened and swallowed livestock, fires have broken out across the land, the earthlines rumble in disquiet, the people are unsettled. The former Master of Willowlands, a reckless tyrant who reveled in his power and neglected his role, died heirless. His younger brother was sent away many years earlier to become a fire priest&#x2014;a calling from which none return to the mortal realm. Yet, he is one year from completing his apprenticeship, and the Circle sends for him to heal his troubled land. Mirasol is the young beekeeper called to become Chalice, to bind together the Circle, the people, and the demesne into a unified entity. She has no training or experience, and the realm is so fractured that uniting it under the rule of a Master who is no longer completely human, and who can touch nothing without burning it, seems an impossible task. As delicately structured as the chambers of a honeycomb, this novel begs to be read slowly. The people of Willowlands are interesting and well crafted, and despite a conclusion that seems rushed and incomplete, this novel is a delight. Because this story is slow paced and does not happen in complete chronological order, reluctant readers will struggle with it. However, mature teens who long for beautiful phrases and descriptive writing will find themselves drinking in this rich fairy tale as if it were honey trickling down their throats.&#x2014;<i>Heather M.

Starting as a London antique dealer, Feild comes into contact with the enigmatic Hamid, a Sufi teacher who leads him into a world of mystery, knowledge, and limitless love. On his journey, which takes him to the mystical sites of Turkey, Feild is forced to confront his own inner weaknesses and falsehoods. Hamid and the events of his search take him again and again into confrontation with the limits of his own being, enabling him to shed the false conditioning that lies between himself and his true nature. This hard-to-put-down adventure is a travelogue in more ways than one. It tells of Feild&#39;s exhilarating explorations into mystical Turkey, a land of whirling dervishes and the tombs of great saints, but also a world that opens into the divine love that lies at the heart of all. This twenty-fifth anniversary edition features a new foreword by Coleman Barks, the foremost modern interpreter of the Sufi poet Rumi, and a new preface by the author.</p><p>Reshad Feild is one of today&#39;s best-known Western Sufi teachers.A Reshad book is not to be missed. -- <i>E.J.

But, as Smith demonstrates, the demand for intelligence far outpaced the ability of any one ally to produce it. For that reason, Washington, London, and Moscow were compelled to share some of their most sensitive secrets. <br><br>Historians have long known about the close Anglo-American intelligence collaboration, but until now the Soviet connection has been largely unexplored. Smith contends that Cold War animosities helped keep this story from a public that might have found it hard to believe that such cooperation was ever possible. In fact, official denials&#x2014;from such illustrious Cold Warriors as Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell and the CIA's Sherman Kent&#x2014;continued well into the late 1980s. <br><br>Smith argues that, contrary to the official story, Soviet-American intelligence exchanges were both extensive and successful. He shows that East and West were not as hostile to each other during the war or as determined to march right off into the Cold War as many have suggested. Among other things, he provides convincing evidence that the U.S. Army gave the Soviets its highest-grade ULTRA intelligence in August 1945 to speed up the Soviet advances in the Far East. <br><br>Based on interviews and enormous research in Anglo-American archives and despite limited access to tenaciously guarded Soviet documents, Smith's book persuasively demonstrates how reluctant and suspicious allies, driven by the harsh realities of total war, finally set aside their ideological differences to work closely with people they neither trusted nor particularly liked.</p><p>Bradley Smith is the author of many books including <i>Reaching Judgment at Nuremberg; The Shadow Warriors: OSS and the Origins of the CIA; The Road to Nuremberg; Operation Sunrise, the Secret Surrender; The ULTRA-MAGIC Deals; The War's Long Shadow;</i> and <i>Adolph Hitler: His Family, Childhood, and Youth</i>."This is a very impressive and important work that should be read by all World War II diplomatic and military as well as intelligence scholars."<i><b>Journal of Military History</b></i><p>"This highly readable, impeccably researched, and brilliant book casts fascinating new light on the tense relations between the Americans, British, and Soviets during the war."<i><b>International History Review</b></i></p><p>"A comprehensive and critical look at the exchange of military intelligence among Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States during the last four crucial years of World War II."<i><b>American Historical Review</b></i></p><p>"A useful and interesting work."<i><b>Journal of Slavic Military Studies</b></i></p><p>"A persuasive, well-documented, and lively account of the Anglo-American-Soviet intelligence relationship in World War II.

His first tragedies were performed in the early 490s, but it was not until 484 that he won his first victory in the competition at the City Dionysia. He fought against the Persians at Marathon in 490 and probably also at Salamis in 480. In 472 he described the battle at Salamis in his Persians, the earliest of his surviving tragedies. In 470, Hieron, the tyrant of the Greek city of Syracuse, invited Aeschylus to Sicily to stage a performance of his Women of Aetna (now lost). After returning to Athens, Aeschylus won first prize at the Great Dionysia with five of his other extant tragedies, the Seven Against Thebes (467), the Suppliants (463), and the trilogy, translated in this volume, known as the Oresteia (458), consisting of the Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, and Eumenides.<br><br>Although Aristophanes, in his comedy the Frogs (405 b.c.), satirizes Aeschylus&#x2019; style as pompous, bombastic, and sententious, in his extant dramas Aeschylus writes in a variety of modes, ranging from straightforward exposition to densely poetic language characterized by distinctive combinations of words and metaphors. The old men in the choruses of Persians and the Agamemnon use sonorous words and speak in complex rhythms that bring profundity and emotional depth to their reflections on the human condition and the inscrutability of the gods. Metrical motifs carried over from the Agamemnon reappear in the terrifying songs of the Furies in the final play of the Oresteia trilogy, the Eumenides.<br><br>In 456, Aeschylus was invited back to Sicily, and he died there. But the Athenians did not forget about him. Half a century later his dramas were so well remembered that even while making fun of his writing style, Aristophanes endorsed his work for its ethical and patriotic values, wishing that Aeschylus could be brought back to life.<br><br>Introduction to Aeschylus&#x2019; Persians<br><br>So far as we know, only three Greek tragedies dealt with recent history rather than age-old myths, and all three portrayed episodes from what we now call the Persian Wars: the twenty-year stretch of armed conflict (499&#x2013;479 b.c.) that pitted various coalitions of Greek cities against the vast, wealthy, monarchic Persian Empire. The first two of these dramatic experiments were the work of Phrynichus, but both are now lost; Aeschylus&#x2019; Persians came third, in 472 b.c. It follows by only eight years the event at its core, the surprising, seemingly miraculous Greek victory over the Persian navy at the island of Salamis, off the west coast of Attica. That victory, achieved despite long odds, had saved most of Greece, and especially Athens, from a fearsome choice between annihilation and subjection to the might of imperial Persia.<br><br>It&#x2019;s no accident that the Persian Wars provided the subject matter for all three of these known Greek historical dramas. The magnitude and scope of this conflict, which appeared to the Greeks to pit the manpower and wealth of all Asia against a much poorer and less populous Europe, gave it mythic dimensions even as it took place, and these only became amplified with the passage of time. Herodotus, writing about the same struggle perhaps half a century after it ended, saw it as the culmination of a millennium-long contest for supremacy between two great ethnopolitical blocs, and therefore as a major turning point in human history.<br><br>In dramatizing the naval battle off Salamis&#x2014;an event he himself, and many members of his audience, had taken part in&#x2014;Aeschylus closed the chronological gap that gives most Greek plays their sense of otherworldliness, but opened up a gulf of cultural distance instead. The play takes place before the palace at Susa, one of the capitals of the Persian Empire, in what is today western Iran&#x2014;a place Athenians could neither visit nor visualize, a city they imagined as replete with fantastic wealth and ruled by immensely powerful monarchs. The exotic robes and soft slippers worn by the actors helped convey this distance to the original audience, perhaps along with musical phrases and choral dance steps suggesting the Far East. It has even been suggested by a modern scholar that the backdrop for the play&#x2019;s production was the ornate tent-cloth beneath which the Persian king, Xerxes, camped during his invasion of Greece&#x2014;one of the proudest spoils of Athenian victory. If true, this story explains how the word sk&#x113;n&#x113;, originally meaning &#x201c;tent,&#x201d; came to denote the stage on which the dramas were played, eventually coming into English in a Latinate spelling, &#x201c;scene.&#x201d;<br><br>But though the play is ostensibly set at a far remove from Athens, the moral and religious ideas around which it revolves are unmistakably those central to archaic and early classical Greece. Aeschylus uses the plight of Xerxes, a defeated king stripped of both his army and his royal robes, to explore the role of hybris and at&#x113;, unsanctioned overreach and the blindness that leads to it, in the rises and falls of individuals and of nations. The Chorus of Persian elders confide their fears about at&#x113; in the play&#x2019;s unique opening ode:<br><br>Kindly and wheedling at first comes reckless At&#x113;,<br><br>but then she leads men into nets and snares;<br><br>no mortal man can jump over, or hope to escape. (96&#x2013;100)<br><br>If the placement of these lines by modern editors is correct (they have been moved from their position as found in the manuscripts), they follow directly after a proud recitation of Persia&#x2019;s long string of military victories, capped by the recent creation of a Persian navy. That navy, as the Chorus does not yet know but Aeschylus&#x2019; audience does, has already been smashed by the Athenian-led Greek fleet at Salamis. The &#x201c;fine-stranded [ships&#x2019;] cables&#x201d; of which the Chorus boast have become the woven &#x201c;nets&#x201d; in which the gods trap those hungry for conquest.<br><br>&#x201c;Cables&#x201d; in the context of this play has a wider resonance than mere ships&#x2019; riggings. As Herodotus&#x2019; account of Xerxes&#x2019; invasion makes clear, the Persian land army marched into Europe by way of an enormous pontoon bridge stretched across the Straits of Hellespont (the modern Dardanelles), the place at which a mile-wide stream of salt water separated Europe from Asia. Enormous flax ropes, stretched between anchored ships, held this bridge together and effectively joined the continents. Aeschylus uses the double meaning of zeugma and related Greek words&#x2014;both a &#x201c;link&#x201d; between two things and a &#x201c;yoke&#x201d; thrust upon a team of animals to subdue them&#x2014;to connect this bridge to notions of enslavement and subjugation. A chariot that Atossa has dreamed of, and that she describes to the Chorus in her opening speech, is pulled by another kind of zeugma&#x2014;the forcible &#x201c;yoking&#x201d; of two enslaved sisters, dressed to represent the peoples of Asia and Europe respectively (the European one, significantly, throws off her yoke, while the Asian one accepts it). A typically dense Aeschylean mesh of motifs begins to form around these zeug- words. Ropes, nets, ships, bridges, and yokes are woven together in this poetic tapestry, all evoking the expansionism of imperial Persia, the nation that sought (in Herodotus&#x2019; words) &#x201c;to make all lands one land&#x201d; (Histories 7.8&#x263;).<br><br>The long stretch of time over which these themes are traced is also typically Aeschylean, reminiscent of the panhistorical scope of the Oresteia. Two generations are represented onstage, an older one to which the Chorus and queen belong, and a younger one represented by Xerxes. But Xerxes&#x2019; father, Darius, who rises spectacularly from the Underworld in ghost form at the play&#x2019;s climax, seems to transcend time with his omniscience about both the past and the future. He looks back over five generations of rule that preceded his own, describing Persia&#x2019;s gradual conquest of Asia as a mandate handed down from Zeus. Xerxes, in his view, has rashly exceeded that mandate by entering Europe, offending not only Zeus but Poseidon&#x2014;here virtually a personification of the straits that Xerxes had bridged, the Hellespont. Aeschylus obscures the fact (or perhaps did not know) that Darius, too, in reality had built an intercontinental bridge (across the Bosporus, according to Herodotus) and campaigned in Europe, against the Scythians north of the Black Sea. The dead king is not a historical portrait so much as an incarnation of all of Persia&#x2019;s past, a past that Xerxes has, in the view of the play, betrayed and partly undone.<br><br>Though Darius rages at his son&#x2019;s arrogance, he also speaks of oracles that foretold the present catastrophe. Xerxes&#x2019; downfall, like that of Agamemnon and other Aeschylean heroes, is the result of both error and fate. On the whole, the Persians suggests that Xerxes is more deserving of pity than blame. The Chorus only rarely express anger toward him, and the solemn, dirgelike procession they share with him in the play&#x2019;s last scene is a moving evocation of shared sorrow. Atossa&#x2019;s anxiety for her child allows us to see Xerxes as a frail and vulnerable creature, a mother&#x2019;s son as well as an army&#x2019;s chief. The queen exits the stage (at line 851) on a touchingly domestic mission, seeking to bring her son a new robe to replace the rags he now wears. When Xerxes enters shortly thereafter, we see that her mission remains incomplete. The tattered glory of the Persian royal house cannot be restored easily, if at all.<br><br>At the heart of the play (from lines 302 to 514) stand the reports of the first Persian soldier to return from Greece, grim catalogs of horror that rank among the finest of surviving Greek messenger speeches. Aeschylus, who had himself fought at Salamis on board an Athenian ship, here demonstrates a remarkable ability to see the battle through the eyes of the enemy. Though the gods are clearly on the side of the Greeks (as signaled by the supernatural voice bidding them to charge and win their freedom), the sufferings of the Persians, both during the battle and in the retreat afterward, are presented with deep compassion and superb artistry. Here and throughout the play, Aeschylus uses sonorous roll calls of Persian casualties, their names resonant with exotic Iranian phonemes, to construct a kind of verbal memorial to the valiant dead. Though he wrote for Athenians, whose city had been razed by the Persians and who had reasons to celebrate the outcome of Salamis, Aeschylus did not indulge in triumphalism or vainglory. There is no irony in the Chorus&#x2019;s final wails of woe.<br><br>The date at which the Persians was produced, 472 b.c., makes it the earliest play in this volume and, quite possibly, the earliest play among all surviving Greek tragedies. Despite this antiquity, the Persians has had great resonance in recent decades, especially as Western military engagement with the Middle East has become a more central issue.

The tall, slender woman I'd lusted after the night before was standing next to me on the tarmac, near her ship, buckling a tan helmet under her chin, flashing me that gap-toothed grin she hid from photographers...." The woman, of course, is Amelia Earhart, and the man describing her is Nate Heller, ex-Chicago cop and private detective to the rich and famous. One of the most original characters in the historical mystery area, Max Allan Collins's Heller has jousted with Al Capone, helped out Clarence Darrow, and probed the killing of Huey Long--taking all his cases very personally. But a bad experience with a sadistic Charles Lindbergh has left him leery of flying, and it will take all of Earhart's charm to get him into a plane from St. Louis to Albuquerque, and then to Los Angeles. It's 1935, and Heller has been hired by Amelia's husband (the conniving publisher G.P. Putnam) to both guard her body and search out possible lovers on a book tour. A warm relationship grows up between the flyer and the detective, and when Earhart disappears a few years later, an overage Heller enlists in the Marines to search for her on the island of Saipan. The story is framed by scenes of a retired Nate in 1970 being persuaded to revisit Saipan by a persistent Earhart researcher, and the conclusions that Collins offers about her fate are as convincing as they are moving and exciting. <i>--Dick Adler</i>In 1935, Nate Heller is hired to escort Amelia Earhart on a speaking tour due to numerous cut-and-paste death threats against her life. Heller suspects the threats are a stunt by Earhart's publicity-hungry husband, and the detective&#x2019;s growing closeness to the bisexual aviatrix leads to a steamy affair. Two years later, when Earhart embarks on her flight around the world&#x2014;and mysteriously disappears over the South Pacific&#x2014;Uncle Sam enlists Heller in a clandestine search of Japanese waters for the popular Earhart...and the top-secret plane she was flying. Blending the unsolved mystery and historical facts swirling around Earhart&#x2019;s disappearance with Heller&#x2019;s sarcastic wit, Max Allan Collins delivers another riveting tale of intrigue and betrayal, taking Heller far from his native Chicago. As he investigates, Heller discovers a treacherous plot involving marital betrayal and the U.S. government. Heller&#x2019;s secret undercover mission leads to Saipan where Earhart is believed to be held prisoner. But Nate&#x2019;s heartbreaking attempted rescue leads the detective to return, many years later, to extract his final revenge.</p><h2>Substance: Inside New Order</h2><p><p>In this final installment of his internationally bestselling three-part memoir&#x2014;including <em>The Hacienda</em> and <em>Unknown Pleasures</em>&#x2014;British rocker Peter Hook focuses on the 1980s New Wave and Dance Punk scene and the rise of one of the most influential bands of the Second British Invasion: New Order.</p><p>1980. Resurrected from the ashes of Joy Division after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis, New Order would become one most critically acclaimed and important bands of the decade and beyond. With their hits "Bizarre Love Triangle", "Perfect Kiss", and "Blue Monday"&#x2014;the biggest-selling 12-inch single of all time&#x2014;Peter Hook and company quickly rose to the top of the alternative music scene. Widely regarded as the godfathers of electronic dance music, their sound would influence Moby, The Chemical Brothers, The Postal Service, The Killers, and other acts that followed in their wake.</p><p>Hook tells the complete, unvarnished story of New Order&#x2019;s founding and evolution; the band&#x2019;s experiences in the New York City club scene and rapid rise to international fame, its impact on house music, techno, and rave; and its eventual rancorous dissolution. Full of Hook&#x2019;s "gleefully profane" (<em>Entertainment Weekly</em>) humor and vivid, witty storytelling, <em>Substance</em> is the most important and certainly the most controversial part of his story, emanating with drugs, booze, and sex. </p><p>Complete with timelines, discographies, gigographies and track-by-track analysis, and exclusive photographs and archival images from Hook&#x2019;s personal collection, it is the definitive, comprehensive history of New Order and a compelling snapshot of the '80s cultural scene in all its neon-hued glory.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;If Joy Division defined my life, New Order shaped it&#x201d;: a fascinating story of sex, drugs, and (indie) rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll; of art, money, and crass stupidity; of blind faith and amazing good luck&#x2014;backed by a soundtrack of truly great songs written by wonderful musicians</p><p>In May 1980 with two acclaimed albums Joy Division had the world at their feet. Then on the eve of their ?rst American tour everything changed. The band&#x2019;s troubled lead singer, Ian Curtis, committed suicide. As Peter Hook has written, &#x201c;One day we were Joy Division, then our lead singer died, and the next time we got together, we were a new band.&#x201d; </p><p>That new band was New Order&#x2014;their label Factory Records, their club The Ha�ienda&#x2014;all based in Manchester, England. Their distinctive sound, a fusion of post-punk and groundbreaking electronica, paved the way for the Indie/dance music explosion that followed. This innovation would earn them the reputation as one of the most influential groups of their generation, changing the course of popular music on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite their success, New Order were always a collision of the visionary and the volatile, forged in the maverick atmosphere of their hometown, an atmosphere of creativity, epic drug use, and boundary-pushing music. More often than not, relationships in the band were fraught with tension, and New Order broke up and reformed with a frequency that kept fans, and the music press, watching their every move. </p><p>The third book in his trilogy, which started with the highly regarded <em>The Ha�ienda: How Not to Run a Club</em> and the bestselling <em>Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division,</em> <em>Substance: Inside New Order</em> is a no-holds-barred account of New Order&#x2019;s entire twenty-seven-year history. Containing outrageous anecdotes, tales of mad excess and astonishing creative perseverance, this book is packed with rich detail, complete discographies, and fascinating technical information about how the music was made. It is also a rollicking read, sure to impress with Hook&#x2019;s talent for recalling the most minute and intimate detail and spinning epic yarns.</p><p>Peter Hook was born in Salford, England, in 1956. He was a founding member of Joy Division and New Order, and now tours both bands&#x2019; music with his new group, Peter Hook and the Light. He also DJs, promoting Fac 51 and The Ha�ienda Classical concerts around the world. He lives in Cheshire, England, with his wife, Rebecca, and children, Heather, Jack, and Jessica, and their dogs, Wilma and Bo.</p><p></p></p><h2>Feudalism</h2><p>Softcover book of 170 pages, plus bibliography.

With a keenly written text and 150 duotones (not seen), and considering Natacha Rambova's background in Egyptology, ballet, and as an exotic costume and set designer (she designed Alla Nazimova's film of Salome, basing her costumes and sets on Aubrey Beardsley's original drawings for Oscar Wilde), Morris's biography bids fair to satisfy in all departments. Born Winifred Shaughnessy in Salt Lake City, Rambova signed up with the Theodore Kosloff Imperial Russian Ballet in Manhattan, was given her stage name by her lover Kosloff, who first seduced her at 17. When she confronted Kosloff with his infidelities, he bloodied her leg with birdshot. Rambova's mother's sister-in-law was sapphic Elsie de Wolfe, the world's first interior decorator, who took on Rambova's mother as her partner; both became millionaires, decorating homes for the rich and mighty. Rambova herself, who read only world mythology both as a child and an adult, inherited the de Wolfe/Shaughnessy artistic temperament, designed her own ballet costumes, became a costume designer for Cecil B. De Mille, later designed Rudolph Valentino's image, costumes, and sets, and then became a writer/director. Valentino had made only one film when she met him and began shaping his publicity. When his studio fought her efforts, Valentino signed a contract excluding her from work on his pictures. She fled and divorced him. Chasing her, Valentino came down with a necrotic hole in his stomach, died of longing in Manhattan, had a riotous funeral. Rambova went on to become a playwright, an actress, and a spiritualist, with her huge labors in Egyptology winning the admiration of Carl Jung. She died at 56, of scleroderma, a disease that dried up her inner organs. A questing, creative woman far ahead of her time--and truly exotic. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Artist and spiritual seeker Natacha Rambova (1896-1966) was born Winifred Shaughnessy in Utah. Educated abroad, she changed her name when she joined a ballet troupe in Russia. Returning to America with her lover, a dancer named Kosloff, she designed sets and costumes for his company, until she left him (for abuse), receiving a bullet wound from his gun in the process. Renowned in Hollywood as a costume designer, Rambova was given credit for Rudolph Valentino's success in the silents. She and the star were married in Mexico in 1921, their life together happy until movie moguls cut off her participation in his films. The couple divorced. Rambova acted, scripted plays and translated, her activities culminating in the study of Egypt's ancient secrets to confirm her religious beliefs. This unconventional, little-remembered, glamorous and talented spiritualist is superbly resurrected by Morris, who teaches art and religion at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif.

Alexandra David-Neel (1868&#x2013;1969), born in Paris to a socially prominent family, once boasted, "I learned to run before I could walk!" In the course of a lifetime of more than one hundred years, she was an acclaimed operatic soprano, a political anarchist, a religious reformer, an intrepid explorer who traveled in Tibet for fourteen years, a scholar of Buddhism, and the author of more than forty books. But perhaps the most intriguing of all her adventures was the spiritual search that led her from a youthful interest in socialism and Freemasonry to the teachings of the great sages of India and culminated in her initiation into the secret tantric practices of Tibetan Buddhism. This book reveals the penetrating insight and courage of a woman who surmounted physical, intellectual, and social barriers to pursue her spiritual quest.</p><p>Ruth Middleton is a sculptor and writer who divides her time between France and the United States. This biography is based on her study of the private, unpublished correspondence, documents, manuscripts, and photographs preserved in the Archives of the Alexandra David-Neel Foundation in Digne, France.</p><h2>Doktor Faustus (German Edition)</h2><p>This novel is about musician Adrian Leverkuhn, told by his friend from childhood, Serenus Zeitblom. From childhood Adrian soaked in knowledge originally a student of theology, he left university and began studying music seriously under his first music teacher, Wendell Kretschmar. Arriving in Leipzig to study, Adrian is decoyed to a brothel by a porter, and that sets the stage for the tragedy of his life, played out literally against the backdrop of his towering musical achievements.</p><p></p><h2>Night of the Moonjellies</h2><p>After the last customer at his Gram&#39;s hot dog stand is served, Mark, who is spending the summer with his grandparent, sails off with Gram and finds a nighttime sea full of moonjellies.

In recognition of his outstanding contribution to the education of young people, he was awarded the 1999 Shining Star Award by the Children's Museum of Southeastern Connecticut. Home is on the North Shore of Boston, where he sometimes appears in theatre productions and is known to show up for almost any occasion with his guitar. He lives with his wife and two children.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- On his way to help grandmother and relatives at a seaside hot dog stand, seven-year-old Mark stops on the beach to pick up a small jellylike substance that he places in a bag of seawater. A moonlight ride with Gram on a fishing boat takes them out on the ocean where thousands of moonjellies shimmer, and the boy slips his treasure back among them. Based on a childhood experience in New England, Shasha's narrative is full of small details that illuminate the story but don't impede it. His rich pastels combined with the text create a strong sense of place and time--the warmth of family relationships, the quiet companionship of the boy and his grandmother, the cheerful hard work and hustle-bustle of the concession stand, and the magic of the glowing sea. His use of light, shadows, and darkness in the luminous full-color double-page spreads invite readers right into the story. Unfortunately, neither the text nor the jacket notes identify exactly what a moonjelly is. Despite this omission, it's a strong debut. --Marge Loch-Wouters, Menasha Public Library, WI<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Found Treasure (Grace Livingston Hill #78)</h2><p>Effie Martin was humiliated!

Here, the author gives a chronological account of how the Wyeth men came to be painters and of how their lives intersected. This "first family of American art" began with Newel Convers (N.C.), Massachusetts-born in 1882, oil painter and noted illustrator for both major magazines and a series of children's classics such as Treasure Island. His son Andrew (1917&#x2013;2009), whose initial artistic success came at the young age of 20, originally used watercolors to create scenes of Maine life, then switched to tempera to paint works such as his poignant "Christina's World." Andrew's son Jamie, the only one of the three still alive, uses combined media to create his portraits of dogs, friends, and neighbors. The text is clear, concise, and very complete for such a slim volume. While the family's existence in the Pennsylvania countryside and the sea coast of Maine often seems idyllic, Rubin does not shy away from recounting family eccentricities, disagreements, and problems. The women in the three artists' lives are shown to be important influences in the men's work, but all of them remain in the background. This well-told biography is beautifully illustrated with color reproductions of all three artists' works and a few black-and-white family photos. While Robert D. San Souci used N.C.'s illustrations to accompany his picture-book text in N.C. Wyeth's Pilgrims (Chronicle, 1991), and Richard Meryman's First Impressions: Andrew Wyeth (Abrams, 1991) is recommended for teenagers, Rubin's is the first title to combine the lives of all three artists in a work geared to a middle school audience. An ideal introduction to the Wyeths.&#x2014;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, formerly at LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny</h2><p><p>Brecht's operatic play produced with Hauptmann, Neher and Weill was first staged in 1930. The story is that three criminals create the city of Mahagonny. Drinking, gambling, prize-fights and similar activities are the sole occupation of the inhabitants, and money rules. Mahagonny is threatened by a hurricane at the end of Act 1, which despite much anticipation and causing much distress simply bypasses the city. In Act 2 following the hurricane nothing is forbidden and various scenes of debauchery occur. Jenny and Jim try to leave but Jim cannot pay his debts and is arrested. Another character arraigned for murder, bribes his way out of it, but Jim has no money and is condemned to death for not paying for his whisky. The opera ends with discontent destroying the city, which burns as the inhabitants march away.</p><p>Translated and with commentary by Steve Giles, this critical edition is the first translation into English of the approved Versuche text of 1930/1. </p><p>An important addition to Brecht scholarship, this edition contains a full introduction to the play, Brecht's writing and notes on the work, editorial notes and variants, and a study of contemporary productions and responses. </p></p><p><p>Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) is acknowledged as one of the great dramatists whose plays, work with the Berliner Ensemble and writing have had a considerable influence on the theatre.

Preface<p></p> <br>Keenen Ivory Wayans stood up, kissed his mom on the cheek, high-fived his younger brother Shawn, and hugged his dad. Smiling broadly, dressed in a sharp, black tuxedo, he paused for a split second, as if to take in the moment, just for himself.<br> <br>It would&#x2019;ve been hard to script a triumph any more complete than the one he was in the middle of. He&#x2019;d just heard his old friend Jerry Seinfeld say it, &#x201c;And the winner of this year&#x2019;s Emmy is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In Living Color.&#x201d; The show had been on the air barely five months. And it was on Fox, which was barely considered a television network, programming only four nights a week. Fox had hemmed and hawed for the better part of a year deciding whether to air the show. They worried it was too black, that white people wouldn&#x2019;t get it, that black people would be offended, that gay people would protest, that Keenen&#x2019;s siblings weren&#x2019;t as funny as he thought they were, or simply that nobody would watch. Keenen had resisted their attempts to bend the show to their ideas, to water it down. He&#x2019;d come too far. If he was going down, he was going down swinging on his own terms.<br> <br>Keenen took one step toward the stage inside the Pasadena Civic Auditorium and wrapped the show&#x2019;s line producer, Michael Petok, in a bear hug. Petok&#x2019;s fianc�e wiped lipstick from Keenen&#x2019;s face and then Keenen embraced the show&#x2019;s other producer, Tamara Rawitt, a short, Jewish former marketing exec who&#x2019;d become his somewhat unlikely lieutenant. As the three of them strode down the aisle toward the dais, they were trailed by Kevin Bright, a supervising producer on the show&#x2019;s pilot. All four walked onstage, Keenen nodded at Seinfeld, whom he&#x2019;d known since the two were young standups at the Improv in New York, took the gold statue from the other presenter, Patrick Stewart, and looked out across the three thousand or so people staring back at him.<br> <br>At thirty-two, Keenen was hardly a fresh, young face anymore. He&#x2019;d spent years slugging it out as a standup. He&#x2019;d been turned down by Saturday Night Live. He&#x2019;d played forgettable roles on forgotten television shows. For years, he&#x2019;d watched the friends he&#x2019;d come up with&#x2014;Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Robert Townsend&#x2014;achieve their dreams. He&#x2019;d done okay too, but sometimes couldn&#x2019;t escape the feeling he was being left behind. Eddie was the biggest comedy star in the world. Robert and Keenen had worked together on a pretty great movie, Hollywood Shuffle, but afterward, Robert got all the shine. Arsenio debuted his hit late-night talk show more than a year before In Living Color launched. For a long time, even Keenen&#x2019;s younger brother Damon&#x2019;s star seemed to be eclipsing his. But this was, finally and undeniably, Keenen&#x2019;s moment. His show was a hit. He just won an Emmy. And to make it a little sweeter, the nominees he beat out included both Saturday Night Live and his old friend and rival Arsenio.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said, looking down at the floor, clearing his throat and exhaling in a short, shallow breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to thank the people who helped make the vision become a reality.&#x201d; He rolled through the expected list of thank-yous&#x2014;his producers, his writers, Fox bigwigs like Barry Diller and Peter Chernin, his manager Eric Gold.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could tell he was beginning to forget people,&#x201d; says Rawitt, recalling the moment. &#x201c;You could see my mouth moving behind him, like &#x2018;Thank this one,&#x2019; &#x2018;Thank that one.&#x2019; I remember before the ceremony Eric Gold frantically rushing over to me and going, &#x2018;Please make him thank me.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Keenen had grown up one of ten kids in the projects in Manhattan, and as he turned his speech toward his family, emotion overwhelmed him. &#x201c;Above all, I&#x2019;d like to thank my family. Those are the ones I&#x2019;ve been doing this for all my life.&#x201d; He covered his mouth, stepped back a half step from the microphone, and quietly told himself, &#x201c;Okay, let me chill.&#x201d;<br> <br>Keenen had never won anything in his life. In Living Color had been nominated in two other categories that year, Outstanding Choreography and Outstanding Writing, and lost both. He figured this would be the same but was prepared in case it wasn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;d planned a great speech to salute his mom, who&#x2019;d been there to support him through all the things he&#x2019;d never won, through his disappointments and failures.<br> <br>Composing himself, Keenen tried to continue. &#x201c;My mother and father are here tonight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Again, he began to choke up, and, out in the crowd, his brother Shawn wiped tears from his own eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna get through this,&#x201d; Keenen pledged before abandoning his resolve. &#x201c;This is for you, Ma, forget it,&#x201d; he said, his voice shooting up a few octaves and cracking. With that, he waved the Emmy, and walked offstage, his arm draped around Rawitt&#x2019;s shoulders.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was the worst acceptance speech ever,&#x201d; Keenen says, looking back on it twenty-five years later.<br> <br>Yet the moment was an unqualified, wide-screen triumph for a show that punctuated the beginning of a new era. There had been black sketch shows before In Living Color, including the short-lived but influential Richard Pryor Show more than a decade earlier. That this was the first one that found an audience said as much about that audience as it did about the show. The culture was changing. For more than fifty years, black life on screens big and small had looked even more demeaning than it did in the real world. Stereotypes were indulged. The Civil Rights Movement came and went without too many substantive changes in front of or behind the camera. There had been important breakthroughs&#x2014;Bill Cosby, Flip Wilson, Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor&#x2014;but the march of progress was exceedingly, agonizingly slow.<br> <br>Until suddenly it wasn&#x2019;t. Not only were there Eddie and Arsenio and Robert and Keenen, but there were Spike Lee and Oprah Winfrey and Reggie and Warrington Hudlin. Soon there would be Chris Rock and John Singleton and Martin Lawrence and the Hughes Brothers and Chris Tucker and Dave Chappelle. The week before that Emmy broadcast, a new show featuring a former rapper named Will Smith had debuted. Many of the era&#x2019;s other rappers would soon become multi-hyphenate stars themselves: Ice Cube, LL Cool J, Ice-T, Queen Latifah, Tupac Shakur. In Living Color&#x2014;a black show created by a black man that seemed to effortlessly cross over to a mainstream audience ready and waiting for it&#x2014;was in many ways at the center of it all. As Keenen put it, &#x201c;We became this bridge in America between white suburban kids and urban kids.&#x201d;<br> <br>Most great success stories are the sum of small failures overcome. When you zoom tightly in on that Emmy coup, cracks appear in the foundation that offer hints as to why In Living Color lasted only five seasons and why Keenen didn&#x2019;t even finish out the fourth: One of the original cast members had been fired a few weeks before the Emmys, nearly the entire writing staff had already turned over, and many of the Fox executives Keenen thanked in his acceptance speech had either left the company or were on their way out soon. Even one of the producers on the podium that night accepting the Emmy alongside Keenen hadn&#x2019;t seen him since he was dismissed after the pilot. This was the unforgiving cauldron in which In Living Color was forged. But for at least those few moments on the auditorium stage that night, things were about as perfect as they could be.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was the feeling of newness and excitement and Here we are! We&#x2019;ve arrived!&#x201d; says David Alan Grier, one of four cast members that survived all five seasons on the show. &#x201c;Two weeks later it was, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s move on.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>In Living Color was nominated for fifteen more Emmys over its next four seasons. It would never win another one again.</p><h2>Who Needs God</h2><p>The author calls for a return to religious commitment in people&#39;s lives in order to fulfill a need for connection, joy, and community, and explains what religion can offer. Reissue.</p><p><b>Harold Kushner</b> has been a rabbi for more than thirty years. His bestselling books have helped millions of people find in faith a source of help for coping with life's problems.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b>Does God Really Make A Difference?</b><br><br><b>"I Don't Believe In Organized Religion."</b><br><br>Paul was a child of the sixties, with his long hair and casual dress. It was one morning in the early 1970s that he sat opposite me in my study. He had called to ask to see me during his college vacation, more as a favor to his father, an active member of my synagogue, than out of any expectation that I would change his mind.<br><br>He told me, "I believe in God. I believe in being kind to people, treating them right, not hurting them. I believe in trying to make the world a better place. But I don't see why you need churches and synagogues, fancy buildings that are always looking for money. I don't see why you need professional clergy (nothing personal, Rabbi), prayer books, organized services, rules and rituals that nobody understands. I don't see why you need so many different religions, all arguing with each other. Why isn't it enough just to tell everybody to be nice to each other?"<br><br>He and I spoke for about an hour. I told him that some people can create lives of holiness all by themselves, the way Mozart could create immortal music without taking piano lessons, but that most of us need a structure and the company of other people to do it. I spoke to him of the need for community, that even if he didn't need organized religion, he should feel the obligation to maintain it for the people who did. (I restrained myself from telling him that if he didn't like organized religion, he had come to the right place; our synagogue was so disorganized it didn't deserve that description.) I spoke of the time-tested wisdom of a tradition thousands of years old, and urged him to accept what it had learned rather than dwell on its mistakes. Paul spoke of how boring his religious education had been when he was a child, how meaningless he found the services he attended with his parents whenever he was home, and how his science and psychology courses at school had helped him to understand why people living in less enlightened times might have needed religion, and why we no longer need it today.<br><br>After an hour, we parted cordially. Paul went back to school. Ultimately, he got married, got a haircut, moved to another state, and has become moderately active in a synagogue there, more, I suspect, as a return to his father's example than as a result of anything I told him that morning. I don't know if he ever thinks about the conversation we had that day. I think of it often.<br><br>This book is written for Paul, the bright, idealistic young man who asked why we need more than the commandment to be nice to each other. It is written for the young woman from a religiously committed home who went off to college and wrote a paper for her freshman English class on why religion harms more people than it helps. It is written for the man and woman from different religious backgrounds who fall in love and can't understand why religion is a source of conflict in their lives rather than a source of joy and inspiration. And it is written for all the intelligent, thoughtful people I have met in my travels -- journalists, radio talk-show hosts, strangers who struck up a conversation with me on a plane -- who had trouble believing that religion could be important to somebody in the twentieth century. This book is written for all the people who don't know that they are religious -- good, honest, caring people who dismiss their local church or synagogue as irrelevant to their lives or find their way to it only at times of emergency or family celebration. (A neighbor once told me, "I think of your synagogue the way I think of Massachusetts General Hospital. I'm glad my life is stable enough that I don't need it often, but when I need it, I'm glad there is a good one around.") Should these same good people feel vaguely lonely, disconnected, unfulfilled, confused by the hard choices they are called on to make in today's world, they will probably never understand the connection between that vague sense of unease and the absence of religion in their lives.<br><br>Recent years have not been kind to the cause of organized religion. Prominent religious personalities have been found to be just as vulnerable to sexual and financial temptations as the rest of us. We read about the very comfortable lifestyles of leading clergymen, or of the corrupt business practices of wealthy donors whom religious organizations have seen fit to honor, and we begin to worry that the dollars in the collection plate are tainted both by the source they come from and by the uses to which they will be put. Churches and synagogues have too often been breeding grounds for hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and small-mindedness instead of being fountains of charity and piety. No wonder that religion has lost its central place in the lives of so many Americans, becoming just one more leisure-time activity, competing for whatever time and energy we have left over after we have done the "important" things in our lives, attracting mostly people who need or enjoy "that sort of thing" and dismissed casually by the rest of us. Even those people who have rediscovered religion in recent years and have given themselves totally to it have not always done much to advance its cause. Their enthusiasm often expresses itself in a fundamentalism bordering on fanaticism, a dogmatism that makes others uncomfortable, an unseemly arrogance in presuming to speak in God's name and condemning anyone who disagrees with them.<br><br>In fact, the past few centuries have not been kind to the cause of organized religion. It may have begun with Copernicus and Galileo discovering that the earth was not the center of the universe -- that the sun did not revolve around it -- and that the Biblical description of the cosmos was inaccurate. Then Darwin taught that human beings evolved from more primitive animals by a blind, morally neutral process of evolution over a period of millions of years. Finally Freud came along and took away our cherished belief that our rational minds made us different from other creatures.<br><br>The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been marked by the enthronement of Science, the objective search for truth that could be tested and verified, in place of Faith, which came more and more to be seen as fairy tales and wishful thinking. Religion, we were told, was an effort to understand and control the unknown, and as more and more became known about how the world worked, the domain of religion grew smaller and smaller.<br><br>At the end of the Book of Job, God confronts those who would challenge Him by saying, "Do you know who fixed [the earth's dimensions], or measured it with a line?...Do you know the seasons when the mountain goats give birth? Can you mark the time when the hinds calve?" (Job 38:5, 39:1) But modern man has found ways to measure the earth. He has studied the mating habits of the wild goat, and even intervened to keep it from becoming an endangered species. Are those grounds for being less impressed with God than our ancestors were?<br><br>To make matters worse, spokesmen for organized religion tried to challenge the scientific discoveries of Galileo, Darwin, Freud, and others, asking the faithful, "Which side are you on?" I have heard otherwise intelligent people tell me that, when God created the world six thousand years ago, along with the mountains and rivers He created <i>dinosaur fossils</i> (not dinosaurs). Why? For no reason except to test the faith of people who would one day live in a scientific age. Would they believe in revealed Scripture or in the misleading results of carbon-14 dating? To the embarrassment of those religious spokesmen (and, they would assure us, to the dismay of God as well), modern men and women have overwhelmingly chosen truth over orthodoxy, and have learned to see religion as the enemy of honesty, progress, and science.<br><br>With a bit more wisdom, might not these religious leaders have seen that same trend as a victory for the cause of religion rather than a defeat? That men and women chose to use their God-given intelligence to explore and understand God's world was a religious act. To seek to understand why earthquakes happen and what causes disease is not an arrogant encroachment on God's domain; it is an example of human beings, in God's image, extending God's process of creation by bringing order in place of chaos. To search for truth instead of relying on ancient guesswork is a religious affirmation, not a repudiation. What religion worthy of its name would base itself on the hope that people would be too intimidated to find out how the world really works? One of my favorite passages in the entire Bible is in chapter 13 of the Book of Job. Job's friends have tried to explain the disasters which have befallen him by assuring him that God knows what is right for the world better than he does, and warn that it is blasphemous for him to complain about God. Job answers them:<br><br>Will you speak unjustly on God's behalf?<br><br>Will you speak deceitfully for Him?...<br><br>What will happen when He examines you?<br><br>Will you fool Him as one fools men? [Job 13:7-9]<br><br>The friends have cautioned Job, "You're saying terrible things about God, and He's going to be very angry at you." Job replies, "If God is a God worth worshiping, I have to believe that He respects my honesty more than your flattery. I may be theologically wrong in what I say about God, but I am saying what I think and feel to be true, not what I think God wants to hear, and I have to believe that God respects that."<br><br>Some readers will remember that in October 1973 the Egyptian and Syrian armies attacked Israel on the morning of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, when all Jews spend the day in synagogue, praying and fasting. Many lives were lost in those first hours of fighting. I heard of a man who went to his rabbi a few days later and told him: "When I heard the news about the fighting in Israel, I slammed my prayer book shut and walked out of synagogue. I said to myself, If God is going to let young Jewish boys be killed for defending their country on Yom Kippur, I'm not going to sit here reciting psalms of praise to Him. I walked out of temple and spent the rest of the day sitting at home, angry at God. Now, three days later, I feel embarrassed by what I did. I feel guilty for walking out on the Yom Kippur service, and I want to know what I can do to make up for it."<br><br>The rabbi told him, "You have nothing to feel guilty about and nothing to apologize for. Your slamming the book down and storming out was probably the most sincere prayer anybody offered in synagogue all day long. The God I believe in is not so fragile that you hurt Him by being angry at Him, or so petty that He will hold it against you for being upset with Him. I believe He is just as upset about people being killed in the war as you and I are, and He respects good, clean, honest anger as much as you and I do, and a lot more than He respects mumbled prayers by people going through the motions."<br><br>I have to admit that some of my best friends are atheists. They never darken the doorway of either church or synagogue. They don't believe in a Supreme Being. They never pray; in some cases, I'm not sure they even understand what it means to pray. And yet they are good, caring, honest people, sensitive to the needs of others, generous with their time, their love, their property. And then there are people -- as a clergyman, I run into them all too often -- who are always at services, always invoking the name of God in their conversations. And so often they turn out to be small-souled people, insecure and judgmental, quick to find fault with others.<br><br>To be fair, I should also say that I know many regular church- and synagogue-goers who are wonderful, warm, almost saintly people, and many nonbelievers who take their rejection of religion as a license to practice selfishness and deceit. But in a sense, that only sharpens the question: What difference does the commitment to religion make in a person's life? If religious belief and church attendance don't necessarily make you a good person, and nonattendance and rejection of religion don't necessarily make you a bad one, what is the point of being religious? What does the religious person get out of his or her faith that the nonreligious person has to do without? Is it something we would all be better off for having, or something that only some people -- the weak and insecure, the spiritually inclined -- need, and the rest of us can do without?<br><br>My answer to that question will be largely a personal one. I can't speak of what religion offers people in general, but I can speak of what it has come to mean to me, how it has shaped my life, and of the impact it has had on the lives of people I have known, people who turned to me as their rabbi, bringing me their problems, their pain, the shattered fragments of their broken dreams.<br><br>Paul, whose conversation with me years ago ultimately flowered into this book, assured me that while he did not believe in religion, he believed in God. I asked him what he meant by that, and he told me that when he contemplates the beauty and intricacy of the world, he has to believe that God exists. That's very nice, I told him, and I'm sure that God appreciates your vote of confidence. But for the religious mind and soul, the issue has never been the <i>existence</i> of God but the <i>importance</i> of God, the difference that God makes in the way we live. To believe that God exists the way you believe that the South Pole exists, though you have never seen either one, to believe in the reality of God the way you believe in the Pythagorean theorem, as an accurate abstract statement that does not really affect your daily life, is not a religious stance. A God who exists but does not matter, who does not make a difference in the way you live, might as well not exist. He would be like a modern European king, a benevolent figurehead trotted out for ceremonial occasions and beloved by everyone because he never does anything. The issue is not what God is like. The issue is what kind of people we become when we attach ourselves to God.<br><br>This, then, is our question: In a world where atheists are often wonderful people and ostensibly religious people disappoint us, in a world where God is a remote presence even for people who claim to believe in Him, what promise does religion hold for us? What can it offer? What difference does it really make in our lives?<br><br>Copyright � 1989 by Harold S. Kushner<br><br>First Fireside Edition 2002|<b>Introduction</b><br><br>I WROTE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I HAD TO. I love the religious tradition out of which I come and I love the several hundred members of the congregation I serve. The enduring frustration of my rabbinic career has been my inability to get my two loves to find and love each other.<br><br>I deal with bright, successful people, people I genuinely like and admire, and I sense that something is missing in their lives. There is a lack of rootedness, a sense of having to figure things out by themselves because the past cannot be trusted as their guide. Their celebrations, from their children?s birthday parties to a daughter?s wedding to a business milestone, can be lots of fun but rarely soar to the level of joy. And as they grow older, I suspect they either confront or actively hide from confronting the thought that "there must be more to life than this."<br><br>There is a spiritual vacuum at the center of their lives, and their lives betray this lack of an organizing vision, a sense of "this is who I am and what my life is fundamentally about." Some look for that center in their work, and are disappointed when corporations choose not to repay the loyalty they demanded or when retirement leaves...</p><h2>Of Mice and Men: The Play</h2><p>Tragic story of the friendship between two migrant workers, George and mentally retarded Lennie, and their dream of owning a farm</p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929).<p>After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <b>In Dubious Battle</b> (1936), <b>Of Mice and Men</b> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1939). <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> won both the <b>National Book Award</b> and the <b>Pulitzer Prize</b> in 1939.</p><p>Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <b>The Forgotten Village</b> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <b>Sea of Cortez</b> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <b>The Moon is Down</b> (1942). <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945), <b>The Wayward Bus</b> (1948), another experimental drama, <b>Burning Bright</b> (1950), and <b>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</b> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <b>East of Eden</b> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <b>Sweet Thursday</b> (1954), <b>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</b> (1957), <b>Once There Was a War </b>(1958), <b>The Winter of Our Discontent </b>(1961), <b>Travels with Charley in Search of America </b>(1962), <b>America and Americans</b> (1966), and the posthumously published <b>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</b> (1969), <b>Viva Zapata!</b> (1975), <b>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</b> (1976), and <b>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1989).</p><p>Steinbeck received the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b> in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the <b>United States Medal of Freedom</b> by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.</p>Gary Sinise&#39;s reading of John Steinbeck&#39;s Of Mice and Men is nothing short of magnificent. Moving effortlessly from an eloquent, understated narrative voice to each character&#39;s quite particular presence, Sinise demonstrates a true command of the medium. At times, Sinise is so convincing that one is hard-pressed to believe that a single reader could be responsible for so many varied characterizations. Thanks to such a skilled reading, this audio edition captures every nuance of Steinbeck&#39;s austere prose and the full power of the novel&#39;s tragic denouement. Top to bottom, it&#39;s a masterful retelling of an American classic. R.W.B.

They're long and thin and splay toed, with buttons of yellow callus on the little toes and a thick stair-step of it on the back of the heel, and a few long black hairs are curling out of the skin at the tops of the feet, and the red nail polish is cracking and peeling in curls and candy-striped with decay. Lenore only notices because Mindy's bent over in the chair by the fridge picking at some of the polish on her toes; her bathrobe's opening a little, so there's some cleavage visible and everything, a lot more than Lenore's got, and the thick white towel wrapped around Mindy's wet washed shampooed head is coming undone and a wisp of dark shiny hair has slithered out of a crack in the folds and curled down all demurely past the side of Mindy's face and under her chin. It smells like Flex shampoo in the room, and also pot, since Clarice and Sue Shaw are smoking a big thick j-bird Lenore got from Ed Creamer back at Shaker School and brought up with some other stuff for Clarice, here at school.</p><p>What's going on is that Lenore Beadsman, who's fifteen, has just come all the way from home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, right near Cleveland, to visit her big sister, Clarice Beadsman, who's a fresh man at this women's college, called Mount Holyoke; and Lenore's staying with her sleeping bag in this room on the second floor of Rumpus Hall that Clarice shares with her roommates, Mindy Metal man and Sue Shaw. Lenore's also come to sort of check out this college, a little bit. This is because even though she's just fifteen she's supposedly quite intelligent and thus acceleratedand already a junior at Shaker School and thus thinking about college, application-wise, for next year. So she's visiting. Right now it's a Friday night in March.</p><p>Sue Shaw, who's not nearly as pretty as Mindy or Clarice, is bringing the joint over here to Mindy and Lenore, and Mindy takes it and lets her toe alone for a second and sucks the bird really hard, so it glows bright and a seed snaps loudly and bits of paper ash go flying and floating, which Clarice and Sue find super funny and start laughing at really hard, whooping and clutching at each other, and Mindy breathes it in really deep and holds it in and passes the bird to Lenore, but Lenore says no thank you.</p><p>"No thank you," says Lenore.</p><p>"Go ahead, you brought it, why not . . . ," croaks Mindy Metal man, talking the way people talk without breathing, holding on to the smoke.</p><p>"I know, but it's track season at school and I'm on the team and I don't smoke during the season, I can't, it kills me," Lenore says.</p><p>So Mindy shrugs and finally lets out a big breath of pale used-up smoke and coughs a deep little cough and gets up with the bird and takes it over across the room to Clarice and Sue Shaw, who are by a big wooden stereo speaker listening to this song, again, by Cat Stevens, for like the tenth time tonight. Mindy's robe's more or less open, now, and Lenore can see some pretty amazing stuff, but Mindy just walks across the room. Lenore can at this point divide all the girls she's known neatly into girls who think deep down they're pretty and girls who deep down think they're really not. Girls who think they're pretty don't care much about their bathrobes being undone and are good at makeup and like to walk when people are watching, and they act different when there are boys around; and girls like Lenore, who don't think they're too pretty, tend not to wear makeup, and run track, and wear black Converse sneakers, and keep their bathrobes pretty well fastened at all times. Mindy sure is pretty, though, except for her feet.</p><p>The Cat Stevens song is over again, and the needle goes up by itself, and obviously none of these three feel like moving all the way to start it again, so they're just sitting back in their hard wood desk chairs, Mindy in her faded pink terry robe with one shiny smooth leg all bare and sticking out; Clarice in her Desert boots and her dark blue jeans that Lenore calls her shoe-horn jeans, and that white western shirt she'd wore at the state fair the time she'd had her purse stolen, and her blond hair flooding all over the shirt, and her eyes very blue right now; Sue Shaw with her red hair and a green sweater and green tartan skirt and fat white legs with a bright red pimple just over one knee, legs crossed with one foot jiggling one of those boat shoes, with the sick white soles--Lenore dislikes that kind of shoe a lot.Clarice after a quiet bit lets out a long sigh and says, in whispers, "Cat . . . is . . . God," giggling a little at the end. The other two giggle too.</p><p>"God? How can Cat be God? Cat exists." Mindy's eyes are all red.</p><p>"That's offensive and completely blasphemous," says Sue Shaw, eyes wide and puffed and indignant.</p><p>"Blasphemous?" Clarice dies, looks at Lenore. "Blasphemous," she says. Her eyes aren't all that bad, really, just unusually cheerful, as if she's got a joke she's not telling.</p><p>"Blissphemous," says Mindy.<br>"Blossphemous. "<br>"Blousephemous. "<br>"Bluesphemous. "<br>"Boisterous. "<br>"Boisteronahalfshell. "<br>"Bucephalus. "<br>"Bamey Rubble."<br>"Baba Yaga."<br>"Bolshevik. "<br>"Blaphemous!"</p><p>They're dying, doubled over, and Lenore's laughing that weird sympathetic laugh you laugh when everybody else is laughing so hard they make you laugh too. The noise of the big party downstairs is coming through the floor and vibrating in Lenore's black sneakers and the arms of the chair. Now Mindy slides out of her desk chair all limp and shlomps down on Lenore's sleeping bag on the floor next to Clarice's pretend-Persian ruglet from Mooradian's in Cleveland, and Mindy modestly covers her crotch with a comer of her robe, but Lenore still can't help but see the way her breasts swell up into the worn pink towel cloth of the robe, all full and stuff, even lying down on her back, there, on the floor. Lenore unconsciously looks down a little at her own chest, under her flannel shirt.</p><p>"Hunger," Sue Shaw says after a minute. "Massive, immense, uncontrollable, consuming, uncontrollable, hunger."</p><p>"This is so," says Mindy.</p><p>"We will wait"--Clarice looks at her watch on the underside of her wrist--"one, that is one hour, before eating anything what soentirelyever."</p><p>"No we can't possibly possibly do that."</p><p>"But do it we shall. As per room discussions of not one week ago, when we explicitly agreed that we shall not gorge when utterly flapped, lest we get fat and repulsive, like Mindy, over there, you poor midge."</p><p>"Fart-blossom," Mindy says absently, she's not fat and she knows it, Lenore knows it, they all know it.</p><p>"A lady at all times, that Metalman," Clarice says. Then a minute, "Speaking of which, you might just maybe either fix your robe or get dressed or get up off your back in Lenore's stuff, I'm not really all up for giving you a gynecological exam, which is sort of what you're making us do, here, O Lesbia of Thebes."</p><p>"Stuff and bother," says Mindy, or rather, "Stuth and bozzer"; and she gets up swaying and reaching for solid things, goes over to the door that goes into her little single bedroom off the bathroom. She got there first in September and took it, Clarice had said in a letter, this Playboy-Playmatish JAP from Scarsdale, and she's shedding what's left of her bathrobe, battered into submission, leaving it all wet in Lenore's lap in the chair by the door, and going through the door with her long legs, deliberate steps. Shuts the door.</p></p><h2>Before You Know Kindness: A Novel</h2><p>For ten summers, the Seton family&#x2014;all three generations&#x2014;met at their country home in New England to spend a week together playing tennis, badminton, and golf, and savoring gin and tonics on the wraparound porch to celebrate the end of the season. In the eleventh summer, everything changed. A hunting rifle with a single cartridge left in the chamber wound up in exactly the wrong hands at exactly the wrong time, and led to a nightmarish accident that put to the test the values that unite the family&#x2014;and the convictions that just may pull it apart. <br><br><i>Before You Know Kindness</i> is a family saga that is timely in its examination of some of the most important issues of our era, and timeless in its exploration of the strange and unexpected places where we find love.<br><br>As he did with his earlier masterpiece, <i>Midwives</i>, Chris Bohjalian has written a novel that is rich with unforgettable characters&#x2014;and absolutely riveting in its page-turning intensity.<br><br>&#x201c;Few writers can manipulate a plot with Bohjalian&#x2019;s grace and power.&#x201d;&#x2014;The <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Chris Bohjalian&#x2019;s many fans will be glad to know he&#x2019;s back on the high wire, expertly balancing topical issues with the more timeless concerns of the human heart.

But it's impossible to picture Chris Bohjalian's bathroom as anything but an <i>Architectural Digest</i> centerfold: polished counters, not a stray thread on the plush towels, the modulated colors sparked to life by fresh flowers from a neighbor's garden.<p> Bohjalian's eighth novel, <i>Before You Know Kindness</i>, is a beautifully observed, delicately balanced portrait of a family that could only come from the hands of a tireless craftsman who keeps reaching into his story to straighten the tulips or tuck in a shirttail. It begins with two EMTs leaning over animal rights' activist Spencer McCullough's gushing shotgun wound and winds back through the ordinary days leading up to the extraordinary accident, and then forward again as Spencer and his family come to terms with what has happened. As ambitious as other Bohjalian novels, <i>Before You Know Kindness</i> spirals out to encompass the larger issues of Spencer's political loyalties and the heartless, passionate world of political spin. Some readers may find Bohjalian's style too smooth. Others will relish the completeness of his vision and his obvious tenderness for even the most difficult of his characters. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>CHRIS BOHJALIAN is the bestselling author of nine novels, including <i>Midwives</i> (a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book and an Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection), <i>The Buffalo Soldier</i>, and <i>Trans-Sister Radio</i>, as well as <i>Idyll Banter</i>, a collection of his magazine essays and newspaper columns.

While government programs assist the poor, and politicians woo the more fortunate, the "Missing Class" is largely invisible and left to fend for itself. <br><br>Missing Class parents often work at a breakneck pace to preserve the progress they have made and are but one divorce or unexpected hospitalization away from sliding into poverty. Children face an even more perilous and uncertain future because their parents have so little time to help them with their schoolwork or guide them during their adolescent years. With little supervision, the younger generation often flounders in school, sometimes falling prey to the same problems that are prevalent in the much poorer communities that border Missing Class neighborhoods. Paradoxically, the very efforts that enabled parents to get ahead financially often inhibit their children from advancing; they are in real danger of losing what little ground their parents have gained.<br><br><i>The Missing Class</i> is an urgent and timely exploration that describes-through the experiences of nine families-the unique problems faced by this growing class of people who are neither working poor nor middle class. Katherine Newman and Victor Tan Chen trace where these families came from, how they've struggled to make a decent living, and why they're stuck without a safety net. An eloquent argument for the need to think about inequality in a broader way, <i>The Missing Class</i> has much to tell us about whether the American dream still exists for those who are sacrificing daily to achieve it.</p><p><b>Katherine Newman</b> is professor of sociology and James Knapp Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University.

In sharing their lives and struggles, these families have done more to educate than any set of statistics or government report ever could. Policymakers, jounalists, think tanks, and people of good conscience everywhere must take notice . . . [<i>The Missing Class</i>] is a call to action to change America . . . Like other books that transformed our nation, [it] will inspire us to work for . . . an America where the family you were born into or the color of your skin never controls your destiny." &#x2014;from the Foreword by Senator John Edwards<br><br>"At last, a focus on people who struggle from month to month with housing, health care and education costs but don't fit into the government's comfortingly minimalist definition of poverty. Newman and Chen give us a vivid, close-up, and often moving look at the urban 'near poor.' An excellent follow-up to Newman's essential body of work on America's economic anxieties."&#x2014;Barbara Ehrenreich, author of <i>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</i><br><br>"With riveting detail, <i>The Missing Class</i> uses the compelling stories of nine families to portray a neglected group&#x2014;more numerous than the officially poor&#x2014;who work hard, play by the rules, yet live on the brink of disaster, one unlucky step away from plunging into poverty. Sensible and realistic programs, Newman and Chen show, could prevent their fall, reduce their insecurity, and help the Missing Class join the middle class." &#x2014;Michael B.

His <i>Letters and Papers from Prison</i> became a prized testimony to Christian faith and courage, read by thousands. Now in <i>Life Together</i> we have Pastor Bonhoeffer's experience of Christian community. This story of a unique fellowship in an underground seminary during the Nazi years reads like one of Paul's letters. It gives practical advice on how life together in Christ can be sustained in families and groups. The role of personal prayer, worship in common, everyday work, and Christian service is treated in simple, almost biblical, words. <i>Life Together</i> is bread for all who are hungry for the real life of Christian fellowship.<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906�1945) was a renowned and beloved Christian minister, seminary professor, and theologian who was imprisoned and later executed by the Nazis for his resistance to Hitler.

Part travel guide, part cookbook, and part photo essay, <i>Eat Drink Delta</i> by veteran food journalist Susan Puckett (with photographs by Delta resident Langdon Clay) reveals a region shaped by slavery, civil rights, amazing wealth, abject deprivation, the Civil War, a flood of biblical proportions, and&#x2015;above all&#x2015;an overarching urge to get down and party with a full table and an open bar.</p><p>There&#x2019;s more to Delta dining than southern standards.

And she introduces us to a new crop of Delta chefs who brine chicken in sweet tea and top stone-ground Mississippi grits with local pond-raised prawns and tomato confit.

Women took enormous risks and achieved remarkable results-often in ways men could not. A quiet Quaker schoolteacher reported information to a Union commander that led to an important victory. Two women provided intelligence that prevented Confederates from breaking the Northern blockade of Southern ports. A teenage girl rushed intelligence to a marching army. Those with social connections invited enemy officers to parties where loose lips let slip critical information. Others galloped on horseback through enemy lines with information concealed in their bodices. They used disguises. They created ciphers. They intercepted military dispatches. They carried secret messages, medicines, and supplies on the rings of steel wires that puffed out a hoop skirt. And they provided accurate information about the enemy's fortifications, plans, troop size, and movements.</p> <p>But the most potent tools in their arsenals were physical charms, flirtations, and the powers of feminine persuasion.</p> <p>A twenty-three-year-old lady cultivated a sweet and subdued voice and hired a phrenologist to help enhance her ability to win friends and influence powerful figures. Spies charmed cabinet-level secrets out of lovesick admirers and bewitched countless officers. Allan Pinkerton, head of the Union Intelligence Service, wrote of the "almost irresistible seductive powers" of Confederate spymaster Rose Greenhow, a widowed mother of four. Pinkerton said that her "forceful, compelling style and abiding attractiveness to men were the underpinnings of her success." They made her an extremely dangerous enemy of the Federal government.</p> <p>Not all of the women and teenage girls who spied in the Civil War were sexy and gorgeous, but many of them were. And that gave them a huge advantage in fulfilling their clandestine missions. Of course, they also were clever, devious, daring, and passionately committed to a cause.</p> <p>Another advantage female spies initially had over their male counterparts was that they were less likely to be searched. It was a time when men prided themselves on being chivalrous, but as the war went on, women were searched more completely, even strip-searched. Mary Chesnut, a prominent Southern diarist, wrote: "Women who come before the public are in a bad box now. False hair is taken off and searched for papers. Pistols are sought for. Bustles are suspect. All manner of things, they say, come over the border (across the lines) under the huge [hoop skirts] now worn. So they are ruthlessly torn off. Not legs but arms are looked for under hoops."</p> <p>Unlike soldiers, spies are defined as criminals in military law. A captured soldier becomes a prisoner of war, but a captured spy usually faces death. Captured women usually were confined in decrepit, unsanitary prisons for several months, and then ordered never to return to enemy soil. At first, a gentleman could not bring himself to order a teenager or a prominent socialite to be shot or hanged, and so women escaped such punishment early in the war. Later on, at least two women were sentenced to hang. One was rescued at the last minute; the other's sentence was commuted.</p> <p>Despite the danger, women spies stayed active. The fate of more than one battle was decided, not by the valor of the soldier, but by movements generals were able to make through information these spies furnished. Several commanding officers testified, in hearty terms of approbation, to the efficiency and fidelity of the women spies who aided them.</p> <p>To their credit, they had broken out of the confines of "a woman's place" in nineteenth-century America to participate in a profession perilous in the extreme. As the grave marker of Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew states, female spies "risked everything that is dear to man-friends, fortune, comfort, health, life itself."</p></p><h2>The Boys&#39; Book: How to be the Best at Everything</h2><p>A title that shows you how to slam dunk a basketball, how to build a basic raft, how to write in secret code, how to find water in the desert, how to do an Ollie on your skateboard, how to work out which way is north without a compass, how to fly a helicopter, how to tie essential knots, how to take a penalty kick and how to build a campfire.</p><p>About the Compiler: <br>Dominique Enright is a freelance writer and editor.

Original.</p><p>Certified by the American College of Sports Medicine as a health/fitness instructor, Joan Pagano has worked In New York City as a personal trainer for more than 15 years. She is the Director of the Marymount Manhattan College Personal Fitness Trainer Certification Program and a member of the IDEA Personal Trainer Committee.A personal trainer in NYC's Upper East Side, Pagano has dedicated the past 16 years of her life to passing her knowledge and passion for fitness on to other women in the hopes of helping them improve their lives and prevent common diseases like osteoporosis. Her first offering in the crowded self-help fitness genre succeeds impressively well as a resource for women of all ages looking to improve their overall health. Like a good personal trainer should, she begins with a three-part fitness test and questionnaire to assess whether the reader should consult a doctor before beginning her program. For true beginners, she provides an anatomy chart that depicts the major muscle groups and the exercises that are best suited to them. She dispels fitness myths like "lifting weights will bulk you up" and "you can spot reduce," and talks about the risk factors, exercise guidelines and restrictions of osteoporosis. Best of all for novices, many of Pagnano's beginner exercises require no special equipment, relying instead on everyday fixtures like chairs, walls and kitchen countertops. (More advanced exercises use free weights, stretch bands and stability balls.) The color photos, diagrams and clear explanations make the exercises easy to follow, and Pagano provides full training programs for improving posture and strengthening the lower, upper and core muscles of the body. This book may be one of the best substitutes for pricey gym memberships and personal trainers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ward covers the Fifties, Geoffrey Stokes the Sixties, Ken Tucker the Seventies and Eighties. Each provides a finely detailed chronicle of the major and minor figuresmusicians, company executives, disc jockeys, and promoters. No new historical interpretation is offered. As the authors tell it, rock sprang from country, gospel, and rhythm-and-blues; reached its creative peak in the Sixties; floundered during the Seventies; and has emerged reinvigorated with the appearance of artists like Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson. Scholars will regret the lack of footnotes and bibliography; general readers will miss the pictures and more informal tone of Rolling Stone 's earlier Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll (Random, 1980. o.p.). However, this is an important basic work that belongs in most libraries. Thomas Jewell, Waltham P.L., Mass.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA Old rock and roll is no fossil. Any previous hit song seems as likely to be heard in a new version these days as in the original on an oldies show. For teens interested in the roots and history of rock music or in the social climate of the last 30 years, Rock of Ages provides detailed information and anecdotes on the music that never did die. Arrangement is largely chronological, with the background and interests of each contributor determining the scope and depth of treatment. There are significant sections on the major figures and genres, with access through an index of performers. Those wishing encyclopedic entries on songs or artists would be better served by other titles, but those seeking more detail or broader coverage on topics such as Motown or Woodstock will find here a fascinating wealth of information.

"Ted" Shackley in December 2002 triggered an avalanche of obituaries from all over the world, some of them condemnatory. Pundits used such expressions as "heroin trafficking," "training terrorists," "attempts to assassinate Castro," and "Mob connections." More specifically, they charged him with having played a major role in the Chilean military coup of 1973.<br><br>But who was the real Ted Shackley? In <i>Spymaster</i>, he has told the story of his entire remarkable career for the first time. With the assistance of fellow former CIA officer Richard A. Finney, he discusses the consequential posts he held in Berlin, Miami, Laos, Vietnam, and Washington, where he was intimately involved in some of the key intelligence operations of the Cold War. During his long career, Shackley ran part of the inter-agency program to overthrow Castro, was chief of station in Vientiane during the CIA's "secret war" against North Vietnam and the Pathet Lao, and was chief of station in Saigon. After his retirement, he remained a controversial figure. In the early eighties, he was falsely charged with complicity in the Iran-Contra scandal. <br><br>Ted Shackley's comments on CIA operations in Europe, Cuba, Chile, and Southeast Asia and on the life of a high-stakes spymaster will be the subject of intense scrutiny by all concerned with the fields of intelligence, foreign policy, and postwar U.S. history.</p><p>Ted Shackley's final CIA position was as associate deputy director for operations.

Even in her own time, she was recognised as a woman of unparalleled power. From exile to being hailed empress, across three marriages and three widowhoods, her life, power and role were extraordinary in their scope and drama. Beautiful and intelligent, she is alternately a ruthless murderer and helpless victim, the most loving mother and the most powerful woman of the Roman empire. She is portrayed in ancient sources as using sex, motherhood, manipulation and violence to get her way, and single-minded in her pursuit of power for herself and her son. Agrippina s life sheds light on the Julio-Claudian dynasty and Rome at its height - the chaos, blood and politics of it all - as well as the place of women in the Roman world.</p> <p>This book follows Agrippina as a daughter, born to the expected heir to Augustus s throne, who was then orphaned, as a sister to Caligula who raped his sisters and showered them with honours until they attempted rebellion against him and were exiled, as a seductive niece and then wife to Claudius who gave her access to near unlimited power, and then as a mother to Nero who adored her until he killed her. She was 44 when she died. It takes us from the camps of Germany during a mutiny, through senatorial political intrigue, assassination attempts and exile to a small island, to the heights of imperial power, thrones and golden cloaks and games and adoration. We will see Agrippina found her own city (Cologne), live up to and then flaunt the greatest ideals of Roman femininity and motherhood, and explore the absolute limits of female power in Rome. The biography of Agrippina is also the biography of the first Roman imperial family - the Julio-Claudians, and of the empire itself.</p></p><p></p><h2>Invasion of the Overworld (Gameknight999)</h2><p><p><b>For ages 10+</b></p><p><b><i>Danger lurks within the shadowy places of MINECRAFT; there's a new villian who seeks to destroy everything!</i></b></p><p>Gameknight999 is pulled into Minecraft...for real.

An incoherently eclectic smorgasbord, the fare here includes dishes that nod blithely at many ethnic cuisines without scrupling over authenticity (chicken breasts with kielbasa a la Cordon Bleu; a dip featuring canned artichoke hearts and jalapenos; shrimp prepared with vodka, ginger, scallion, soy sauce and peanut oil). The desserts, however, feature an array of quintessentially hospitable Southern pies (buttermilk, chess, sweet potato-praline) and sweets. And cooks whose idols are in the entertainment industry, not the kitchen, will certainly lap up Shore's goodnatured name-dropping: "Barbara and Frank Sinatra were coming to dinner. . . .

From her humble beginnings in a Rio de Janeiro shantytown to the tragic death of her fourth husband, legendary billionaire banker Edmond Safra, in an arsonist&#x2019;s fire in their Monte Carlo penthouse, <em>Gilded Lily</em> combines all the elements of compelling fiction in an absolutely enthralling account.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>The mesmerizing biography of one of the world's richest, most intriguing women&#x2014;philanthropist and socialite Lily Safra</p></blockquote><p>In the early morning of December 3, 1999, Lily Safra stood shivering in her nightgown on the grounds outside her sumptuous Monte Carlo penthouse where, just hours before, her fourth husband, reclusive billionaire Edmond Safra, died in a fire. An American nurse employed by the Safra family was eventually convicted of the arson death. Overnight, Lily became one of the wealthiest widows in the world.</p><p>The Brazilian-born Lily Safra was no stranger to tragedy. In 1969, her second husband, the Brazilian multimillionaire Alfredo Monteverde, died from two gunshots to the chest. The Brazilian authorities ruled it a suicide. In 1989, her beloved eldest son and four-year-old grandson died in a car accident. But just who is Lily Safra? Despite having become a fixture in society columns for her generous charity work and lavish parties, the elegant and enigmatic widow has remained in the background.</p><p><em>Gilded Lily</em> tells Lily Safra's story for the first time.

The prehistoric Hohokam and Mimbres people used design motifs in rock art and pottery while the present day Hopi and Navajo use them in the arts and crafts of today. While many of the symbols and patterns found on pottery, basketry, rugs and jewelry have histories and meanings assigned to them, many do not. Southwest Indian Designs answers some of the more commonly asked questions and provides valuable insights into those designs that do not have specific meanings. Included are symbols and explanations of Zuni, Navajo, Hopi, Tewa, Acoma, Pueblo, Mimbres, and Hohokam designs. Mark Bahti has re-created close to 200 symbols and their variations making this an inexpensive, yet invaluable guide to those interested in the art, history and culture of the Native Americans of the Southwest. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>My People&#39;s Prayer Book, Vol. 3: Traditional Prayers, Modern Commentaries--P&#39;sukei D&#39;zimrah (Morning Psalms)</h2><p><p></p><blockquote><p>"The prayer book is our Jewish diary of the centuries, a collection of prayers composed by generations of those who came before us, as they endeavored to express the meaning of their lives and their relationship to God.

He spent 27 years at the magazine, introducing readers to California wines, American caviar, and more. JAMES VILLAS' THE TOWN &amp; COUNTRY COOKBOOK contains not only all of the recipes that have appeared in TOWN &amp; COUNTRY up to 1985 but also many others the author has either developed or collected from numerous sources. Nearly 600 recipes, regional as well as international, are included. There are recipes for such old-fashioned favorites as French Onion Soup, short ribs of beef, crab cakes, and pecan pie. In addition, Villas sparks the appetite and inspires the imagination with such creative dishes as duck rillettes; onion, feta cheese and olive pizza; johnnycakes with creamed shrimp and oysters; saut�ed rabbit with anchovies and black olives; scrambled eggs with crabmeat and vermouth; and strawberry-peach cobbler. Very few of the dishes utilize fancy, expensive ingredients; not a single recipe is beyond the scope of any chef with a grasp of kitchen basics; and suggested menus and numerous cross-references throughout make the book a pleasure. This practical yet inventive cookbook will appeal to sophisticated Americans who know the fundamentals of cookery and are interested in producing dishes that have new flair, that investigate today's fascination with fresh native ingredients and that easily lend themselves to individual interpretation.</p><p>As food and wine editor of Town &amp; Country, Villas (American Taste) has learned that "the rich and successful love and respect a great hamburger as much as an elaborate fish baked in puff pastry." To accommodate these cosmopolitan tastes, he has assembled recipes ranging from peanut butter sandwiches to quail stuffed with spicy oysters, from baked beans to fiddlehead ferns with mushrooms. But the most ordinary dishes have the Town &amp; Country touch: the peanut butter sandwich is finished with overlapping slices of peeled kiwi fruit, and the baked beans, eschewing any trace of tomato, contain clove-studded onion, dry mustard and dark rum; to vichyssoise, Villas adds cucumbers, and ordinary rump roast must be basted with three bottles of imported ale. The recipes throughout are simple enough for the novice. Illustrations not seen by PW. Foreign rights: Robin Straus.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Five words of advice on reading Elizabeth Bowen: Resist the urge to skim. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, Bowen's writing rolls ever onward, accruing the sensations and ironies of conscious living till the final effect is massive. This is not prose for people who like their fiction with a cool, Calvin Klein-like minimalism. Bowen's people are keenly aware, and she seems to catalogue every sweaty moment, every betraying glance. The reader must stay right there with her, because hidden among lengthy descriptions of sea air and drawing-room politics are pithy asides worthy of great humorists: "Absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends." Skimmers miss out.<p> <i>The Death of the Heart</i> is Bowen's most perfectly made book. Portia, an orphan, comes to live in London with her half-brother, Thomas, and his wife, Anna. A child of sin raised in a series of shabby French hotels, Portia is possessed of a kind of terrible innocence. Like Chance the Gardener in pigtails, she literally can't comprehend evil or unkind motives. Unfortunately for her, she falls in with Anna's friend Eddie, who seems to be made entirely of bad motives. Though the plot follows Portia's relationship with Eddie, the novel's real tension lies between Portia and Anna, as the girl comes to grief against the shoals of Anna's glittering, urbane cynicism. But the book transcends the theme of innocence corrupted. As in Graham Greene's <i>The Quiet American</i>, Bowen inverts the formula to show the destructive power of innocence itself: </p><blockquote>Innocence so constantly finds itself in a false position that inwardly innocent people learn to be disingenuous.... Incurable strangers to the world, they never cease to exact a heroic happiness. Their singleness, their ruthlessness, their one continuous wish makes them bound to be cruel, and to suffer cruelty. The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet--and when they do, their victims lie strewn all around.</blockquote> Bowen has a fine eye for such shadings of morality, but finer still is her understanding of the way humans bump up against the material world. Her writing on weather, both emotional and meteorological, compares with the best of Henry James: "One's first day by the sea, one's being feels salt, strong, resilient, and hollow--like a seaweed pod not giving under the heel."<p> Always a sensitive observer of the way we live, in her lesser books Bowen deals in mind games and then delivers trumped-up, bloody endings. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, she keeps all the action between her characters' ears, and comes up with one of the great midcentury psychological novels. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Elizabeth Bowen is widely considered to be one of the greatest novelists of this century. While her novels masquerade as witty comedies of manners, set in the lavish country houses of the Anglo-Irish or in elegant London homes, they mine the depths of private tragedy with a subtle ferocity and psychological complexity reminiscent of Henry James.<p>The Death of the Heart, a story of adolescent love and the betrayal of innocence, is perhaps Bowen's best-known book. When sixteen-year-old Portia, recently orphaned, arrives in London and falls for an attractive cad -- a seemingly carefree young man who is as much an outsider in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of 1930s drawing rooms as she is -- their collision threatens to shatter the carefully built illusions of everyone around them. As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sharp sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.</p></p><h2>Germans of Louisiana</h2><p><p>During the antebellum period, New Orleans was the largest German colony below the Mason-Dixon line. Later settlements moved upriver between New Orleans and Donaldsonville, near Lecompte, and in North Louisiana near Minden.

During the antebellum period, an estimated 12 percent of the New Orleans population was German, making the city the largest German colony below the Mason-Dixon line. Other significant settlements were established in north Louisiana near Minden and in the Louisiana prairie near Rayne. Today, descendents of these immigrants make up over a fourth of the population. This book examines the state's German buildings, towns, monuments, prominent individuals, and more. This first comprehensive study of the German history and heritage of Louisiana provides information on the historical background of the colonial era, as well as immigration and settlement patterns of the nineteenth century. Also included are details of typical trades and businesses founded, owned, or dominated by German immigrants, a history of churches and synagogues in the New Orleans area, and facts about German social and civic life. Ellen C. Merrill received grants from both the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities and the National Park Service to research this book. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Newcomb College in 1957 and spent three years in Europe at the University of Heidelberg, where she earned a diploma from the School of Translators and Interpreters. She returned to the States to obtain her Ph.D. in German language and literature from Tulane University. She has taught at Dillard University, Nicholls State University, Loyola University, and the University of New Orleans and has served as the director of the German archive at the Historic New Orleans Collection.</p><p>Though Louisiana's French and Spanish roots are well documented, it comes as a surprise to many that there were significant German settlements along the Mississippi River beginning in 1724. In the years before the Civil War, an estimated 12 percent of the New Orleans population was German. This book details the historic sites, settlement patterns, and important individuals whose influence is felt even today.</p></p><h2>A Mew To A Kill (Mystic Notch Cozy Mystery Series)</h2><p>When the ghost of a murder victim appears in Last Chance Books, middle-aged bookstore owner, Willa Chance, must find the ghost&#39;s killer or risk being haunted with it&#39;s unwanted advice forever.

Elevating his exquisite and unique form of illustrated epistolary novels (beware: as before, some letters are not bound into the book) to new heights, Bantock&#39;s art has never been finer, the sweet sensuality has never been more poetic, and the drama of their spiritual mission has never been so exalted.

Alan Clark quoted a German general's remark that the British soldiers were 'lions led by donkeys'. But he made it up.</p><p>Indeed, many established 'facts' about 1914-18 turn out to be myths woven in the 1960s by young historians on the make. Gordon Corrigan's brilliant, witty history reveals how out of touch we have become with the soldiers of 1914-18. They simply would not recognize the way their generation is depicted on TV or in Pat Barker's novels.</p><p>Laced with dry humour, this will overturn everything you thought you knew about Britain and the First World War.

A few of the songs were written after the emancipation, but all were inspired by slavery. The wild, sad strains tell, as the sufferers themselves could, of crushed hopes, keen sorrow, and a dull, daily misery, which covered them as hopelessly as the fog from the rice swamps. On the other hand, the words breathe a trusting faith in the life after, to which their eyes seem constantly turned.1830-1899</p><h2>Dead Man&#39;s Walk</h2><p>Struggling with the harsh frontier as young Texas Rangers, Gus and Call share life-changing adventures with deadly natural disasters, incompetent officers, cunning Native American warriors, and romance</p><p>In this prequel to McMurtry's 1986 Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call are invincible young bucks, Texas Rangers, full of youthful energy and, quite frankly, full of themselves. That is until they're utterly consumed by the vicious battlefield of the early-19th-century Wild West. Their journey takes them across barren deserts and raging rivers and through steep and snowy mountains, often on foot and with barely enough provisions and clothing to keep them from certain death. The constant threat of attack by Comanches keeps them awake nights, fearing for their lives--and for good reason. "Buffalo Hump reached down and grabbed the terrified boy by his long black hair. He yanked his horse to a stop, lifted Zeke Moody off his feet, and slashed at his head with a knife, just above the boy's ears. Then he whirled and raced across the front of the huddled Rangers, dragging Zeke by the hair. As the horse increased its speed, the scalp tore loose and Zeke fell free. Buffalo Hump had whirled again, and held aloft the bloody scalp."<p> This bedraggled group of adventurers--on their foolhardy expedition to seize Santa Fe from the Mexicans (who also prove to be formidable enemies)--includes a salty assortment of cowboys, scouts, fortune seekers, and a fat and sassy whore nicknamed "The Great Western." McMurtry's adept storytelling paints a portrait of the Wild West that at times is palpable. One can almost smell the campfires, the body odors, and the long-awaited piece of meat after weeks without a proper meal. <i>Dead Man's Walk</i> will satisfy your craving for adventure, without having to put your life on the line.</p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

Held every April since 1896, the race follows a 270-kilometer course between the suburbs of the French capital and the northern industrial city of Roubaix, and its long history and location have made it pivotal in attracting cycling&#39;s superstars and testing their reputations. This lavish, large-format book recounts the history and excitement of Paris-Roubaix. With authoritative text from the top sportswriters at France&#39;s &#34;L&#39;Equipe,&#34; the book presents the inside story of the race, its great riders, its traditions, and its secrets. Arranged chronologically, &#34;Paris-Roubaix&#34; includes an exclusive, behind-the-scenes chapter to bring readers directly into the action. Hundreds of spectacular color and black-and-white photos, many of them never before collected in book form, round out this memorable portrait of one of cycling&#39;s greatest events.</p><p><p>Introduction by Bob Roll.</p> <p>"The authors have approached the race in a clever and unusual fashion. Rather than following a chronology, the majority of the eleven chapters of <i>Paris-Roubaix: A Journey Through Hell</i> are divided into different aspects of the race. These include: the cobblestones themselves; the impact of the weather; messed-up finishes; unexpected winners; the Roubaix velodrome; and a brilliant chapter devoted to the effects of getting a flat tire. There is a gallery of the most celebrated winners and the whole book is stuffed with marvellous photos taken from the archives of <i>L'�quipe</i>. There appear to have been photographers present at every dramatic crash, or else there are always so many crashes that you just have to stand around and wait."<b> --Pezcyclingnews.com</b></p> <p>"Something about this book has grabbed me in a way no other cycling book ever has...This book punched me so hard it knocked a tooth loose. <i>A Journey Through Hell</i> brings the race back to life, capturing the faces of the people who make the race what it is. From the pros themselves to the police to the spectators, this book packs your lunch and drags you and your family out for a day at the races."<b> --Belgium Knee Warmers</b></p> <p>"This is a book to die for... The writing is of a stunningly high standard, not just informative but descriptive, emotional, involving and delightful. The same can be said of the incredible number of monochrome and colour photographs of a quality that would not disgrace a copy of Rouleur magazine... I read [the book] completely oblivious to the distractions around me...and kept reading passages out loud to anyone within listening distance."<b> --TheWashingMachinePost.net</b> </p> <p>"This pictorial history of Paris-Roubaix is the first time I have seen the brutality of the event, and the fragility of the riders that are forced to race it, fully exposed in print. The quality of the photography is phenomenal, right from the sepia memories turn of the last century to the multicoloured, multinational new-millennium action, and the captions and story are written in a quirky, amusing style that encourages you to look at each image again."<b> --Bicycling Magazine South Africa</b> </p> <p>"The book contains hundreds of images, both in colour and black-and-white, and this is one of the reasons for its superiority over video recordings of the race. With the photograph on the page there is time to study the image and time and time again the background is as interesting as the actual subject... The eleven chapters of the book are cleverly themed to take you through the different facets of the race. When you arrive at chapter eleven you will have taken a much appreciated journey through more than a century of life and racing."<b> --Lightweight News</b></p> <p>"VeloPress has released a stunning ode to the history of cycling's greatest one day race in this elegant coffee table book...While the stories of the riders, of the race and of the people who fight for it are compelling, it is the photographs that make this book so stunning. A pictorial history not only of the race but of the sport through the ages graces the pages of this remarkable book. Both monochrome and color image quality are nothing short of perfection and shot selections are absolutely riveting. We see riders in triumph, riders in agony. We see riders coursing through history on safety bikes and on modern carbon fiber machines. We are witness to men trying to conquer the formidable beast that is the Hell of the North, frozen in time through the ages. <i>Paris-Roubaix: A Journey Through Hell</i> is a must for any cycling fan. Its stunning coffee table layout and spectacular photography will earn its place as one of the greatest cycling books of all time."<b> --East Coast Mountain Biking</b> </p> <p>"One can't help but get inspired to ride some rough stuff after reading <i>Paris-Roubaix</i>." <b> --BikeRadar.com</b> </p> <p>"If you could make a crosscut through the race, you'd see layers which, mundane on their own, have converged into something fascinating. <i>Paris-Roubaix: A Journey Through Hell</i> is easily the most comprehensive effort to perform that crosscut and allow English-speaking fans a chance to examine those layers...Almost the second you crack the cover, the drama of the race explodes off the page." <b> --PodiumCafe.com</b> </p> <p>"Nothing will get you pumped and primed for the upcoming race, as well as for a new season of bike riding, like <i>Paris-Roubaix: A Journey Through Hell</i>...[The book] keeps alive the elements of folklore and poetry that are Paris-Roubaix. <i>Paris-Roubaix</i> is a celebration of the most famous of races, as well as of a beautiful sport that's been around long enough to have talented authors gloriously sing its praises and deify its participants....If you need motivation to tackle a sloppy spring, look no further than this book." <b> --Mountain Flyer</b></p>David Herlihy (d. 1991) was Barnaby Conrad and Mary Critchfield Keeney Professor and Professor of History at Brown University.</p><h2>George B. McClellan and Civil War History: In the Shadow of Grant and Sherman</h2><p>Perhaps no other Union commander's legacy in the Civil War has been the subject of as much controversy as George B. McClellan's. Since the midpoint of this century, however, he has emerged as the complex general who, though gifted with administrative and organizational skills, was unable and unwilling to fight with the splendid army he had created.<br>Thomas J. Rowland argues that this interpretation rests squarely within the context of general historical verdicts of the way in which the North eventually triumphed. Civil War scholars have found the quality of Union leadership in the early years of the war wanting, and that it was not until U.S. Grant and W.T. Sherman emerged that success was ensured. On the other hand, Grant and Sherman knew failure but were judged less harshly than was McClellan.<br>In George B. McClellan and Civil War History, Rowland presents a framework in which early Civil War command can be viewed without direct comparison to that of the final two years.</p><p>Thomas J. Rowland is an instructor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.As the subtitle suggests (In the Shadow of Grant and Sherman), the wartime records of Grant and Sherman, and the handling of those records by McClellan critics, provide counterpoints for restoring perspective. Such simplicity makes this historiography easy for all. It is good reading that can be enjoyed by both the general public and Civil War specialists. -- <i>Trenton Times, January 10, 1998</i></p><h2>The Dead Man&#39;s Brother</h2><p>Ovid Wiley, an art smuggler-turned-respectable art dealer, is forced to help the CIA find a renegade priest who has gone missing with millions in church funds along with a woman from Ovid&#39;s past. Original.</p><p>One of the most celebrated authors in the field of fantasy and science fiction, <b>Roger Zelazny</b> was nominated a remarkable 14 times for the field&#x2019;s two most prestigious awards, the Hugo and the Nebula, and won 6 and 3 of each, respectively. He wrote such classic fantasy novels as <i>Lord of Light, My Name Is Legion,</i> and <i>Damnation Alley</i>, as well as the best-selling "Amber" series.Around the time the late Roger Zelazny&#x2019;s masterpiece, the Amber Chronicles series, was launched in 1970 with the landmark Nine Princes in Amber, the author penned a book outside the bounds of his usual fantasy genre. This never-before-published novel falls solidly within the spy-thriller category. However, the main character, Ovid Wiley, with his less-than-respectable background as an art smuggler and dealer, could almost be a prototypical Indiana Jones, sans the cornball movie-serial overtones but with an extra dollop of Indy&#x2019;s preternatural good luck. When Wiley&#x2019;s former partner turns up dead on his art gallery floor, the NYPD likes Wiley for the crime; then the CIA shows up, promising to make the murder charge go away if Wiley will help track a renegade Vatican priest. Plot twists galore ensue, as Zelazny orchestrates the whole in high style. The jaunty first-person narrative, the wry wit, and a very light touch of the paranormal will appeal to hard-boiled crime fans as well as the huge base of Zelazny readers. The author&#x2019;s son, Trent, supplies an afterword. --Elliott Swanson</p><h2>House of Suns</h2><p>Six million years ago, at the dawn of the star-faring era, Abigail Gentian fractured herself into a thousand male and female clones, which she called shatterlings.

But now someone has murdered most of them, and the survivors must find those responsible if the race is to survive. Narrator John Lee generally gives a strong narration, except when he encounters a recurring structural problem in the book: The story features an omniscient narrator, but, from time to time, without warning, the narration is taken over by the main female character. At these points, Lee&#39;s voice doesn&#39;t change, making it difficult to follow the shift in point of view. However, when Lee performs the female character&#39;s dialogue, his voice goes up an octave, making those moments easy to follow. M.S. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Man Ray: American Artist</h2><p>Man Ray is the quintessential modernist figure - painter, sculptor, photographer, filmmaker, poet, and philosopher. One of the most fascinating of the Surrealists who transformed the Paris art world during the 1920s, Man Ray was an enigma - a Dadaist who revered the Old Masters, an anarchist pursued by wealthy patrons. Driven to make his mark in as many art forms as possible, he struggled bitterly to win acceptance as a painter even as his skill as a photographer brought him world wide fame. Man Ray came to know personalities such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Salvador Dali, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst, and Coco Chanel, and he photographed virtually every important figure in the arts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>The aim of these two books is the same: the delineation of Man Ray, inventive photographer, painter, sculptor, and film maker who dominated the iconoclastic inner circle of 20th-century art. It is typical of this paradoxical artist that one must look to the biography for historical framework. In the autobiography, wonderfully animated in style and filled with imagination and candor but little chronological documentation, Man Ray presents his image of Man Ray. While this update of a 1963 publication is an atmospheric stream-of-life account and Baldwin's workthe first full-length biographyan anecdotal examination of the artist's restlessness, curiosity, and wittily skewed vision of reality, both portraits convey Man Ray's passion and commitment. They also have in common the cooperation of Juliet Man Ray, who supplied photographs and documents from her own private collection and memories of her husband. Published to coincide with a forthcoming traveling retrospective exhibit, these books provide background for understanding this self-contained artist. Expect more on Man Ray this season; see "State of the Arts" in LJ 's September 15 issue. Ed. Paula Frosch, Metropolitan Museum Lib., New York<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Man Ray was a bundle of enigmasa Dadaist who revered the Old Masters, an anarchist coddled by wealthy patrons, an obsessive documenter of his own works who was relentlessly determined to erase his personal history. Born Emmanuel Radnitsky, son of a Philadelphia garment factory worker and a strict, sharp-tongued housewife, he grew up in Brooklyn, fled to Paris and eluded ties with a family proud of their bohemian son. He became a chess addict and neglected his first wife; he writhed with jealousy when his mistress-model scored success as an artist. Driven to make his mark in as many art forms as possible, the photographer/object-maker/collagist bitterly struggled to win acceptance as a painter. Turning to Hollywood as a filmmaker in the 1940s, he was dismissed by the art world. Man Ray's lighthearted autobiography Self-Portrait (Forecasts, Aug. 12) hides his inner contradictions; Baldwin, biographer of William Carlos Williams, unmasks his quirks in a model biographyjudicious, compulsively readable, rooting its subject in his cultural milieu. The first full-length life of the artist, it is a remarkable feat of sleuthing.

Trefan Morys, Morris's home between the sea and mountains of the remote northwest corner of Wales, is the 18th-century stable block of her former family house nearby. Surrounding it are the fields and outbuildings, the mud, sheep, and cattle of a working Welsh farm.<br><br>She regards this modest building not only as a reflection of herself and her life, but also as epitomizing the small and complex country of Wales, which has defied the world for centuries to preserve its own identity. Morris brilliantly meditates on the beams and stone walls of the house, its jumbled contents, its sounds and smells, its memories and inhabitants, and finally discovers the profoundest meanings of Welshness.</p><p>Journalist, historian, and travel writer, Jan Morris is the renowned author of more than forty books. Her work ranges from such classics as <i>Pax Britannica, The World of Venice, Hong Kong, </i>and <i>The Matter of Wales</i>&nbsp;to the masterly essays published in <i>Journeys, Destinations, </i>and <i>Among the Cities. </i>She has also written a novel, <i>Last Letters from Hav. </i>An Honorary Litt.D. of the University of Wales and Glamorgan, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), she lives in Wales.With simple elegance and grace, renowned travel writer Morris (Pax Britannica) reflects on her home in Wales, its beautiful setting and the nature of being Welsh. First in a series of literary travel memoirs, this slim and charming volume offers a crisp account of the turbulent history of the Welsh and their battle to maintain their language and culture in the shadow of their more powerful neighbor. Weaving in some Welsh poetry and lore along the way, Morris leads readers on a winding road ("didn't I say we were long-winded?") to her home. "We called the building Trefan Morys, partly after the estate, partly after the Welsh spelling of my surname; and so it was I told you to be patient! that this modest old structure, built for livestock, became instead a Writer's House in Wales." Morris delivers a jaunty tour in lively, lighthearted prose. From the scent of burning wood to the bilingual weathervane atop the cupola, readers are transported by rich, romantic detail and the author's warmth. Sweetened with her observations on the architecture, countryside, neighbors, the past and the future of her country, this little book is a satisfying brew. Trefan Morys is vividly and lovingly described: the cat Ibsen, the book tower, the "untidy yard," the mystical woods surrounding the property. Via her home, her writing and her beloved Wales, Morris defiantly preserves her identity in the face of a rapid-fire communications culture. The book is humble yet astute, homespun yet profound. (Jan.)Forecast: Fans of Morris will be thrilled to have another small volume to add to their collection, especially since she claimed that the publication of this year's Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere (Forecasts, Aug. 20) was to be her last.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Aunts Aren&#39;t Gentlemen</h2><p>On doctor&#39;s orders, Bertie Wooster retires to the village of Maiden Eggesford but his rest-cure is interrupted by Aunt Dahlia who wants him to nobble a racehorse, Vanessa Cook who wants him to act as go-between for her and Orlo Porter -and Orlo Porter himself who would tear Bertie limb from limb if he ever discovered that Bertie and Vanessa were once engaged.

He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.&#34;Wodehouse&#39;s idyllic world can never stale. He will continue to release future generations from captivity that may be more irksome than our own.

The route selected by the author and his 77-year-old Portuguese companion took them, on foot and by car, from Lisbon and the southern port of Sagres, from which Prince Henry the Navigator launched western expansion, to the northern Douro Valley, famed for its port wine. With a sure, deft touch, Proper evokes the essence of places as different as the walled city of Evora, replete with Roman-Moorish-Christian grandeur, and the inviting countryside, where they paused to sample savory fare and test the trout streams. The book offers an engaging portrait of a small country "top-heavy with history" and its hospitable though in many cases impoverished people. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of the most enjoyable ways to get to know a country is through reading autobiographical travel writing. Proper and his guide, a 77-year-old Portuguese, ramble throughout Portugal and reminisce about the history and heroes, language, culture, and character of the Portuguese people. The author frequently quotes from Luis Vaz de Camoes's The Lusiads, and he enlivens his work with subtle humor, whether describing quiet fishing expeditions or detailing culinary delights while conversing with locals in the countryside. His reflections are not light reading but more an intellectual study of many aspects of the country and its people. The coverage of his journey is well balanced and enriching.

How and when did Christianity become a separate religion from the Judaism into which Jesus was born? To what extent was his power over contemporaries political rather than religious? A. N. Wilson's answers to these questions will fascinate readers of every shade of faith or skepticism.</p><p>Noting that Matthew, Mark, and Luke "claim that the Eucharist was instituted during or after the traditional Jewish Passover meal," A.N. Wilson says that the stories concluding the synoptic gospels, "the arrest of Jesus, his trial, his execution, must be [works] of fiction, since it is unthinkable that the Jews would have broken their most sacred religious observances in order to put a man on trial." <p> In <i>Jesus: A Life</i>, A.N. Wilson spends most of his energy on such demythologizing. Like Renan, Schweitzer, and Crossan before him, this biographer strives to tell a story about the "historical reality" of Jesus' life. To that end, Wilson summarizes scads of contemporary biblical scholarship, sifts through loads of archeological evidence, liberally cites the Dead Sea Scrolls, and, most productively, attends his finely-tuned literary ear to the biblical texts. </p><p>You can take or leave Wilson's secondhand scholarship; that sort of thing is outdated before it gets printed. But you cannot deny the power of his original literary observations. He thinks the most trustworthy clues for answering the question of who Jesus really was are to be found in the Gospel passages that resist or rupture neat theological readings. "Almost in spite of the Christ of the theologians, Jesus has survived: a man doodling in the dust with his finger ...; a man who could liken the love of God to a fussy Jewish mother searching a house high and low for a lost coin...." This is trustworthy writing. For some readers it will be emotionally upsetting. But it's hard to imagine anyone for whom it wouldn't be ethically edifying. "We can accept some Church version of Jesus, or if it makes more appeal to us, we can accept a 'heretic' version; or we can make one up by ourselves," Wilson writes. "A patient and conscientious reading of the Gospels will always destroy any explanation which we devise. If it makes sense, it is wrong. That is the only reliable rule-of-thumb which we can use when testing the innumerable interpretations of Jesus' being and his place in human history." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>When the Morning Comes: Book 2 in the Sisters of the Quilt Amish Series</h2><p>Her relationship with fianc� Paul Waddell in tatters, Hannah Lapp has fled her secluded Old Order Amish community in hopes of finding a new home in Ohio with her shunned aunt.

Her body ached from the absence of the life she&#x2019;d carried inside her only days ago. When the conductor opened the door to the outside, a cold blast of night air stole her breath. He stepped off the train with her bag in hand and turned to help her onto the platform.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad out here tonight.&#x201d; The man glanced across the empty parking lot, then passed her the traveling bag. It weighed little in spite of carrying all she owned&#x2013;all she&#x2019;d begin this new life with. &#x201c;You got somebody meeting you, young lady?&#x201d;<br><br>Wishing she had a decent answer to that question, Hannah studied her surroundings. The old depot was dark and deserted. Not one sign of life anywhere, except on the train that was about to depart. She glanced the length of the train in both directions. There wasn&#x2019;t another soul getting off.<br><br>The conductor&#x2019;s face wrinkled with concern. &#x201c;The building stays locked 24/7. It&#x2019;s no longer an operating depot, but we drop people off here anyway. When somebody lands in Alliance, they better have made plans.&#x201d;<br><br>A few hundred feet to her right stood a small blue sign with a white outline of a phone on it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got plans,&#x201d; she whispered, hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t ask any other questions.<br><br>He nodded, grabbed the two-way radio off his hip, and said something into it. Of course he wouldn&#x2019;t ask anything else. He had a job to do&#x2013;a train to catch.<br>As he stepped back onto the train, it slowly pulled away, its whistle sounding long and loud. For hours as she&#x2019;d traveled from Owl&#x2019;s Perch, Pennsylvania, heading for Alliance, Ohio, the train whistle had stirred a sense of hope and well-being within her. But as her haven of shelter and food disappeared around a bend, a deep feeling of aloneness shrouded her.<br><br>She turned toward the sign with the emblem of the phone on it. Unsure whether she had enough information to get her aunt&#x2019;s phone number by calling 411, she began to realize how foolhardy she&#x2019;d been not to make calls during the layover at Union Station in Pittsburgh. She&#x2019;d been so afraid she would miss her next train that she had stayed on a seat, waiting.<br><br>Wrapping her woolen shawl even tighter around her, she made her way to the phone. But once she stood in front of the sign, she saw there wasn&#x2019;t a phone after all. She walked around the pole, searching. She spanned out a bit farther, circling the empty lot. The sign was wrong.<br><br><i>God, what have I done?<br></i><br>She&#x2019;d freeze before morning. Walking around the building again, Hannah searched for a nook to shelter her from the wind. Finding nothing, she crossed the graveled parking lot to the edge of the paved road. To her left was a hill with a sharp curve and no hint of what lay beyond it. To her right, down about half a mile, groups of lights shone from high atop poles.<br><br>Shivering, she set out for the lights, hoping they would lead her to shelter of some sort. Each step made her abdomen contract in pain. In her great efforts to keep Paul, she&#x2019;d lost everything. <i>Everything.<br><br></i>The word went round and round in her head, draining her will. In the distance to her left, she could make out the backsides of a few homes that looked dilapidated even under the cover of night. It appeared that Alliance, or at least this part of it, was every bit as poor as she was. She approached the lighted area. Sidewalks and old-fashioned stores lined each side of the street. Most of the shops had glass fronts, and each was dark inside except for some sort of night-light. Desperate for warmth and too weary to worry about laws, she wondered if one of the doors might be unlocked. The door to each store sat back a good six to eight feet between two walls of storefront glass, like a deep hallway. The moment she stepped into one of the passageways, the harsh wind couldn&#x2019;t reach her. She knocked on the door before trying the knob. The place was locked.<br><br>She walked to the next store and tried again. It, too, was locked. Moving from doorway to doorway, she grew uncomfortably sleepy. Too tired to try anything else, Hannah leaned back against the cold plateglass window of the dime store and slid to a sitting position. She pulled out the two dresses she&#x2019;d packed in her traveling bag and put one dress over her and scooted the other one under her, trying to get some distance between herself and the icy concrete. She removed her prayer <i>Kapp, </i>loosened her hair from its bun for added warmth, and tied her Kapp back on tight.<br><br>Sleep came in sporadic measures as her body fought to stay warm. Every time she nodded off, thoughts of the life she&#x2019;d left behind startled her. Her family&#x2019;s gray stone farmhouse, set amid rolling acreage. The Amish heritage that had once meant roots and love. Memories of her mother teaching her how to sew, cook, and tend to infants. Mary, her dearest friend, standing by her even when it meant she&#x2019;d lose her fianc�, Luke, Hannah&#x2019;s own brother.<br><br>Images of Paul filled her mind, making the thoughts of her family vanish. She chided herself for longing for him. But her inner chastisement did nothing to stop the memories of him from pelting her. She could hear his laughter as they played board games, see the strength that radiated from his hands and arms as they worked the garden side by side, and feel his joy on the day she accepted his proposal.<br><br><i>Stop.<br></i><br>Her body shook harder as cold from the concrete seeped through her clothes, and she wondered if she&#x2019;d wake in the morning or freeze to death during the night.<br><br>From somewhere on the sidewalk came the sound of footsteps. Prying her eyes open, she glimpsed through the dark shadows of night and drowsiness to see the silhouette of a man at the end of the long, glass entryway. Her heart pounded, but waking to full consciousness seemed impossible. Maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t see her.<br><br>The next time she forced her eyes open, the broad shoulders and lanky body of a man were directly in front of her. Still unable to get fully awake, she couldn&#x2019;t see any more than his profile.<br>With no energy or place to run, Hannah waited&#x2013;like an animal caught in a trap.<br><br>He removed something from around him and placed it over her. The miserable chills eased, and she could no longer control her eyelids as warmth spread over her.<br><b><br>Chapter 2<br></b><i>Perry County, Pennsylvania<br></i><br>Grumbling to herself, Sarah grabbed her winter shawl off the peg and headed out the back door to fetch a load of wood. Early morning sun gleamed against the fresh layer of snow. As she made her way to the lean-to, the strange events of yesterday weighed heavy.<br><br>She tracked snow onto the dirt floor of the covered shed as she crossed to the stacked woodpile. Placing a split log in the crook of one arm, she mumbled complaints about Samuel not getting his chores done last night. <i>Daed </i>would hear about this.<br><br>The sound of a horse and buggy approaching made her turn. Matthew Esh was driving, and his mother, Naomi, sat beside him. As Sarah stood under the lean-to, watching them get out of the buggy, Matthew spotted her. He dipped his head to come under the low roof. &#x201c;Sarah.&#x201d; He nodded his greeting rather coldly, then without another word proceeded to stack firewood in the crook of his arm.<br><br><i>Of course he has nothing to say to me. </i>He was Hannah&#x2019;s friend. And once a man saw the perfect beauty and poise of Sarah&#x2019;s older sister, he never glanced her way again. Daed came out of the barn and spoke to Naomi for a moment before taking the horse by the lead. He motioned for her to go into the house.<br><br>Through the open double doors to the barn, Sarah could see Levi still mucking it out after milking the cows and wondered where Luke was. Before she thought to ask Matthew what he and his mother were doing here, he strode down the hill toward her home. Sarah followed in silence. When she entered, her three younger siblings were eating at the kitchen table. Naomi stood in front of the wood stove, warming her hands. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful bitter out there.&#x201d; Her voice sounded different today.<br><br>Matthew unloaded the wood and headed out the back door again. &#x201c;<i>Ya, </i>it is cold.&#x201d; Sarah dropped a couple of split logs into the woodbin and closed the lid. &#x201c;The potbellied stove has been eating wood like it&#x2019;s candy, and the house is still a little cool.&#x201d;<br><br>A few minutes later Daed stalked into the kitchen from the coatroom, looking no one in the eye. Since he&#x2019;d pulled off his mucky work boots, only his black woolen socks covered his feet. &#x201c;Sarah, fix a pot of coffee while I fetch your mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew came in the back door with wood piled so high in his arms he could barely see over it. Sarah moved to the woodbin and lifted the lid. Then she removed a few sticks off the top of his load. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right, Sarah. I got it.&#x201d; Matthew&#x2019;s words were void of his usual warmth.<br><br>Normally, from the moment Naomi and Matthew arrived, he and her father engaged in easy banter about horses, cows, and such. But this didn&#x2019;t have the feel of a normal conversation. Sarah decided her best chance of being allowed to stay and hear a few bits of gossip was to get something into the oven as quickly as possible. After putting the coffee on to brew and filling the cups with hot tap water to warm them, she began kneading the batch of sourdough that Esther had made and set out to rise last night.<br><br>When <i>Mamm </i>and Daed came into the kitchen, they said nothing to her about leaving. But they told Esther, Rebecca, and Samuel to take their breakfast upstairs and stay there until someone called for them.<br><br>By the time Sarah returned from helping Esther get their two youngest siblings up the steps with their plates of food and drinks, the coffee was almost ready. She set the cream and sugar on the table before dumping the water from the cups down the drain and pouring the fresh brew. Placing a mug in front of each person, she was relieved that she seemed invisible to them. While they fixed their coffee, she placed a few leftover cinnamon rolls from breakfast on the table. The long, awkward silence in the room made her wonder if any of them would say what was on their minds before she was banned to the upstairs with the others.<br><br>Daed tapped his spoon against the rim of his cup and focused on Naomi. &#x201c;I suppose this visit is about Hannah.&#x201d;<br><br>Watching everyone out of the corner of her eye, Sarah stood quietly at the counter, molding a handful of dough into a dinner roll. Her insides quivered. Just the thought of Hannah&#x2019;s fall from on high made her feel guilty as well as triumphant.<br><br>Naomi cleared her throat. &#x201c;I think the community was kept in the dark about the...about Hannah&#x2019;s secret for far too long.&#x201d; Hannah&#x2019;s secret? The wad of dough in Sarah&#x2019;s hands plopped onto the floor. She grabbed it up.<br><br>&#x201c;Sarah.&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s voice vibrated the room. <br><br>She wheeled around. &#x201c;Yes, Daed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be in here.&#x201d;<br><br>She wanted to beg for permission to stay, but the look in Daed&#x2019;s eyes kept her from asking.<br><br>Matthew pushed his coffee cup to the center of the table. &#x201c;Zeb, there&#x2019;s no keepin&#x2019; what&#x2019;s taken place a secret. If ya don&#x2019;t share it, your children will have to rely on the rumors they&#x2019;ll hear to try to figure things out.&#x201d; Matthew closed his eyes and drew a deep breath before opening them again. &#x201c;But this is your home and your family.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father clicked his tongue but gave a slight nod, letting Sarah know she could stay. Naomi smoothed the front of her apron. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen our bishop so set in his mind against a body like he was Hannah. It was his and the preachers&#x2019; stand concerning anything she said that made them force her to stay alone...&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah couldn&#x2019;t catch a breath. She&#x2019;d gone to the bishop and told him things about Hannah, but surely that wasn&#x2019;t what had caused this trouble. Daed pushed his coffee mug away. &#x201c;What new actions by my eldest daughter have caused you to come see me?&#x201d;<br><br>Naomi looked to her son briefly. &#x201c;Zeb, Ruth.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;I hope you can find it within your hearts to forgive me.&#x201d;<br><br>Mamm&#x2019;s eyes opened wide. &#x201c;Forgive you? You&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>Daed glanced at Sarah. &#x201c;We all know the tricks Hannah pulls. Don&#x2019;t take on guilt for her.&#x201d;<br>Sarah turned her back as if she hadn&#x2019;t heard him and washed the dough off her hands, hoping this conversation wouldn&#x2019;t end up pointing a finger in her direction.<br><br>He continued. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve come here thinking something is your fault, you&#x2019;re wrong. No one can take blame for the birth except Hannah herself.&#x201d; Sarah turned to face her mother. &#x201c;Hannah has a baby?&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother stared blankly at the table. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t repeat that, Sarah.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew rose from his seat. &#x201c;None of what&#x2019;s happened is gonna stay a secret.&#x201d; He pointed Sarah toward the bench seat. &#x201c;I think ya should tell her.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah sat, unable to accept what she was hearing. How could her unmarried sister have a baby?<br><br>Daed buried his head in his hands. &#x201c;Okay, okay. Ruth, tell her, but make it brief. Clearly, Naomi and Matthew have something they need to talk about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I...I don&#x2019;t know what to say.&#x201d; Mamm shook her head. &#x201c;Do I tell her what Hannah said is true or what you think is true or what the bishop says is true?&#x201d; Her eyes misted. &#x201c;Tell me, Zeb. What am I to say about Hannah and about my firstborn grandchild?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ruth.&#x201d; Naomi&#x2019;s calm voice cut through the freshly loosened anger. &#x201c;I was there after Hannah gave birth. I would stake my life, even my son&#x2019;s life, that the child Hannah gave birth to was indeed conceived the way she told you.&#x201d;<br><br>Mamm clamped her hands on the table and buried her face against them, wailing, &#x201c;Oh, God, what have we done?&#x201d; She looked up at her husband. &#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d;<br><br>Resentment carved Daed&#x2019;s face as he shook his head. &#x201c;Naomi has the heart of a mother. Of course she believes what Hannah told her.&#x201d;<br><br>Naomi stood, facing the head of the household in his own home. Almost instantly the sadness etched across her face disappeared, and fury replaced it.<br><br>Sarah had never seen any woman face a man with such anger. Matthew wrapped his hand around his mother&#x2019;s arm and motioned for her to sit. When she did, he nodded his approval. &#x201c;Mamm was in the room and overheard Hannah praying about the attack. Hannah didn&#x2019;t even know she was there.&#x201d;<br><br>The room fell silent.<br><br>Hannah was attacked? Sarah dismissed that idea immediately. Her sister had made that up to cover her sin. Zeb shoved the teaspoon into the sugar bowl, dumped a scoop into his coffee, and stirred it briskly. &#x201c;More likely that you heard her repenting for telling us she was attacked when she wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Naomi rose, pointing a shaky finger at Daed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare spread lies about your daughter, Zeb Lapp, because you can&#x2019;t face the truth.&#x201d; She snapped her shawl tighter around her shoulders. &#x201c;No wonder she didn&#x2019;t want you to know where she was going. She knew you&#x2019;d never believe her; that you&#x2019;d only condemn her.&#x201d; She turned to Matthew. &#x201c;Get your coat. This man would rather listen to the sounds roaring inside his own head.&#x201d;<br><br>Mamm rose, looking horrified. &#x201c;My Hannah&#x2019;s gone?&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly it became clear; this piece of information was the reason the Eshes had come here today.<br><br>Naomi placed her hand on Mamm&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Matthew and I took her...</p><h2>Under the Cajun Moon</h2><p><p><b>What Secrets Can Be Found by the Light of the Cajun Moon?</b></p><p>New Orleans may be the "Big Easy," but nothing about it was ever easy for international business etiquette expert Chloe Ledet.

This series follows the topical arrangement in the Primary Mathematics U.S. Edition series. The exercises generally provide problems of a similar style and level of difficulty as the course material covered in the Primary Mathematics U.S. Edition series. The exercises are short and specific, so instructors may assign only those topics in which the students need more practice. This, together with the simple language used, will allow students to review mathematics with minimal guidance. The practice material aims to consolidate and reinforce the mathematical skills taught in the Primary Mathematics series. Answers are in the back of each book.Author: Tinoh ChanFormat: 132 pages, PaperbackPublisher: Marshall Cavendish Int l, Singapore Pvt LtdISBN: 9810193777</p><p></p><h2>Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders</h2><p>The story of Rumpole&#39;s first client takes place fifty years earlier and follows the fledgling barrister&#39;s participation in the trial of a man accused of murdering his father and a friend with a German pistol, a case that established Rumpole&#39;s career and began to shape his cantankerous personality. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.Bill Wallis is brilliant as Horace Rumpole, the cantankerous hero of 12 volumes of Mortimer's Wodehousian accounts of life at the Old Bailey. In this entry, Rumpole is writing his memoirs about his long and irreverent career, beginning with his first case, the Penge Bungalow murders. (This is also the case that brought him to the attention of Hilda, aka, "She who must be obeyed.") Wallis's Rumpole sounds just as he should as he narrates his memoir: gruff, wistful, funny, sly, and infuriatingly lovable. Fans of the BBC-TV series will be pleased to learn that he sounds much like its star, Leo McKern, without trying to be a carbon copy. Wallis is also word-perfect with the wild assortment of secondary characters, from members of the British legal profession (who range from loopy to pompous) to Hilda's refined friends to the denizens of the witness box. Listeners will be sorely tempted to listen to this in one sitting and will be disappointed when it ends. R.E.K.

Special edition! Two large-format hardcover volumes in a slipcase at a special bestseller price Picasso called Dal? &#34;&#34;an outboard motor that&#39;s always running.&#34;&#34; Dal? thought himself a genius with a right to indulge in whatever lunacy popped into his head. Painter, sculptor, writer, and filmmaker, Salvador Dal? (1904-1989) was one of the century&#39;s greatest exhibitionists and eccentrics?and was rewarded with fierce controversy wherever he went. He was one of the first to apply the insights of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis to the art of painting, approaching the subconscious with extraordinary sensitivity and imagination. This lively monograph presents the infamous Surrealist in full color and in his own words. His provocative imagery is all here, from the soft watches to the notorious burning giraffe. A friend of the artist for over thirty years, privy to the reality behind Dal?&#39;s public image, author Robert Descharnes is uniquely qualified to analyze Dal??both the man and the myth.</p><p>Robert Descharnes, a photographer and writer, has published studies of major artists, among them Antoni Gaudi and Auguste Rodin. Since 1950, he has been documenting and cataloguing Dali&#39;s paintings and writings, and is now considered the leading expert on the artist. Shortly before Dali&#39;s death, Descharnes was appointed by him to take charge of the rights to his works, within the Societe Demart Pro Arte B.V., of which Descharnes is president. Gilles Neret was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent. He organized several art retrospectives in Japan and founded the SEIBU museum and the Wildenstein Gallery in Tokyo. He directed art reviews such as L&#39;Oeil and Connaissance des Arts and received the Elie Faure Prize in 1981 for his publications. Neret is the editor of TASCHEN&#39;s catalogues raisonnes of the works of Monet and Velazquez, as well as the author of Dali - The Paintings and Erotica Universalis. He died on August 3, 2005.&#34;Bound to become the standard reference work...&#34; Le Figaro, Paris&#34;</p><h2>STAR CATS: A FELINE ZODIAC (1ST PRT IN DJ)</h2><p>Lesley Anne Ivory&#39;s new book combines her dual interests in astrology and cats, while the theme provides her with a wealth of imagery suggested by the rich pictorial symbolism of the zodiac.

He was curator of the Hip-Hop Nation exhibit, and has been active in the Northwest music scene for more than twenty-five years. He lives in Seattle. <b>Charlie Ahearn</b> is a filmmaker whose 1982 landmark film Wild Style has become a hip-hop classic. He lives in New York City.Based on the "Hip-Hop Nation" exhibit at Seattle's Experience Music Project and the project's ongoing Oral History Program, this history of the beginnings of hip-hop in 1970s New York City is a lavishly illustrated and lovingly compiled homage to the many artists who contributed to the birth of what soon became and remains today, more than 25 years later a worldwide cultural institution. Editors Fricke and Ahearn (director of the hip-hop film Wild Style) weave the insights and attitudes of nearly 100 of the key players into a multihued and multiracial tapestry that illustrates what the excitement of that era and its music was all about. Since the hip-hop style was first developed in the Bronx borough of New York City as a dance-floor alternative to the then-prominent "disco" sound, the oral narrative is dominated by the voices of well-known DJs: Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. But much of the success of the book is derived from its exploration of the roots of other related hip-hop trends: how the massive new styles of graffiti were both a response to urban violence as well as a way to provoke the interest of downtown New York avant-garde artists; how the competitive world of break dancing was rooted in the rapidly changing and fading gang culture of the Bronx; and how many women were far more active and influential in all types of hip-hop styles than was obvious or recognized at the time. This is an excellent documentation of how early hip-hop expressed "a balance between pain and the celebration of music and movements." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Odessa file</h2><p>The suicide of an elderly German Jew explodes into revelation after revelation: of a Mafia-like organization called &#34;Odessa&#34; ...of a real-life fugitive known as the &#34; Butcher of Riga&#34; ..of a young German journalist tumed obsessed avenger.......and, ultimately, of brilliant, ruthless plot to reestablish the worldwide power of SS mass murderers and to carry out Hitler&#39;s chilling &#34; Final Solution.&#34;</p><p>"Much more complex than the Jackal... intriguingly fact packed with relentless exporting, a protagonist propelled by an unstoppable force as suicidal as that of a lemming, and a time-factored chase ticking off to an explosive climax."-- <i>The Cleveland Press</i>. <p>The suicide of an elderly German Jew explodes into revelation after revelation: of a Mafia-like organization called <i>Odessa</i>. </p> <p>"A carefully thought out, meticulously researched, documented... highly suspenseful work of fiction."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p> <p> ...of a real-life fugitive known as the "Butcher of Riga"</p> <p>...of a young German journalist turned obsessed avenger. </p> <p>"Every bit as exciting as its noted predecessor and even eerie."--<i>Cosmopolitan</i>.</p> <p>...and, ultimately, of brilliant, ruthless plot to reestablish the worldwide power of SS mass murderers and to carry out Hitler's chilling "Final Solution." </p> <p>"A highly superior combination of real-life facts and suspense fiction."--<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p>"Every bit as exciting as its noted predecessor and even eerie."-- <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. <p>"A carefully thought out, meticulously researched, documented... highly suspenseful work of fiction."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p> <p>"Much more complex than the Jackal... intriguingly fact packed with relentless exporting, a protagonist propelled by an unstoppable force as suicidal as that of a lemming, and a time-factored chase ticking off to an explosive climax."--<i>The Cleveland Press</i>. </p> <p>"A highly superior combination of real-life facts and suspense fiction."--<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p></p><h2>MYSTER IMAGE ND P (Nancy Drew Mystery Stories)</h2><p>Nancy sets out to locate a kidnapped actress and to clear one of her father&#39;s clients, a renowned photographer, accused of stealing ideas for his images.</p><p></p><h2>Conan The Destroyer</h2><p>In the fabled city of Shadizar, sultry Princess Tamaris hires Conan to recover the magical gem known as the Heart of Ahriman.

But his unit&#39;s mission stayed the same: act as the eyes and ears of the 101st deep in the dreaded A Shau Valley--where the NVA ruled. Relentless thick fog frequently made fighter bombers useless in the A Shau, and the enemy had furnished the nearby mountaintops with antiaircraft machine guns to protect the massive trail network that snaked through it. So, outgunned, outmanned, and unsupported, the teams of L Company executed hundreds of courageous missions.

We can't hear what they're saying!"<br><br> "Is he hurt?. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;is he .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." No one dared to say the words, and through the crowd again and again, the same words. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's happening?. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;what happened?. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;President Kennedy's been shot. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;the President. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;in Dallas. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;what happened? . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;President Kennedy. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;he isn't .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." No one quite believing it at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone wanting to think it was a bad joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you hear that President Kennedy's been shot?" "Yeah<i>. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;then what?</i> What's the rest of the joke, man?" There was no rest of the joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only frantic talking, and endless questions, and no answers.<br><br> There were confused images on the screen with replays of the motorcade breaking up and speeding away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter Cronkite was on the air, looking ashen.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The President has been seriously wounded." A murmur went through the Savannah crowd, and it seemed as though every student and teacher at Savannah High School were pressed into that one tiny room, and crowding in from the hallways.<br><br> "What'd he say?. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;what did he <i>say</i>?" a voice from the distance asked.<br><br> "He said the President is seriously wounded," a voice from the front started back to the others, and three freshmen girls started to cry, as Paxton stood somberly in a corner in the press of bodies around her, and watched them. There was suddenly an eerie stillness in the room, as though no one wanted to move, as though they were afraid to disturb some delicate balance in the air, as though even the tiniest motion might change the course his life would take. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;and Paxton found herself thinking back to another day, six years before, when she was only eleven. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;Daddy's been hurt, Pax. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brother George had told her the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother had been at the hospital with her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;He liked to fly his&nbsp;&nbsp;own plane to go to meetings around the state, and he'd had to bring it down in a sudden thunderstorm near Atlanta.<br><br> "Is he?. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;will he be okay? .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."<br><br> "I .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." There had been a strange catch in George's voice, a terrible truth in his eyes that she had wanted to run and hide from.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been eleven then, and George was twenty-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were fourteen years apart and several lifetimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paxton had been an "accident," her mother still whispered to friends, an accident that Carlton Andrews had never ceased to be grateful for, and which still seemed to startle Paxton's mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice Andrews had been twenty-seven years old when their son George was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;It had taken her five years to get pregnant with him, and as far as she was concerned, her pregnancy was a nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sick every day for nine months, and the delivery was a horror she knew she would always remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;George was born by cesarean section, finally, after forty-two hours of hard labor, and although he was a big beautiful ten-pound baby boy, Beatrice Andrews promised herself that she would never have another baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an experience she wouldn't have repeated for anything, and she saw to it with great care that she wouldn't have to. Carlton was, as always, patient with her, and he was crazy about his boy. George was the kind of boy any father would have loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a happy, easygoing, reasonably athletic boy, with a serious penchant for his studies which also pleased his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs was a&nbsp;&nbsp;quiet, happy life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlton had a healthy law practice, Beatrice had an important role with the Historical Society, the Junior League, and the Daughters of the Civil War.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her life was fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she played bridge every Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was there that she felt the first twinge, that for the first time she felt suddenly violently nauseous. She assumed she had eaten something off at the League breakfast that day, and went home to lie down right after her bridge game.&nbsp;&nbsp;And three weeks later she knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of forty-one, with a fourteen-year-old son about to enter high school, and a husband who wasn't even gracious enough to hide his delight, she was pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;This pregnancy was easier for her than the first, but she didn't even seem to care.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so outraged by the indignity of it, the embarrassment of being pregnant again when other women were thinking about grandchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't want another baby, she had never wanted another child, and nothing her husband said seemed to appease her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the tiny, perfect, angelic-looking little blond baby girl they put in her arms when she awoke barely seemed to console her.&nbsp;&nbsp;All she could talk about for months was how foolish she felt, and she left the child constantly with the huge, purring black baby-nurse she had hired when she was pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth McQueen was her name, but everyone called her Queenie.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she wasn't really a nurse by trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had borne eleven children of her own, only seven of whom lived, and she was that rarest&nbsp;&nbsp;of rare gifts of the South, the old beloved black mammy. She was filled with love for everyone, but most especially for children and babies, and she loved Paxton with a passion and a warmth that no mother could have surpassed had she given birth to her, and certainly, Beatrice Andrews didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;She remained uncomfortable around the little girl, and for reasons she herself couldn't really explain, she always kept her distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The child always seemed to have sticky hands, or she wanted to touch the delicate bottles of perfume on Beatrice's table and she invariably spilled them, and somehow mother and child always seemed to make each other nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Queenie who comforted her when she cried, whose arms she ran to when she was hurt or afraid, Queenie who never left her, even for a moment.<br><br> There were no days off in Queenie's life.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nowhere she really wanted to go on a day off, her children had their own lives now, and she couldn't imagine what would happen to Paxxie if she wasn't there to help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father was always good to her, and he loved that child so, but her mother was a different story.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Paxton grew older, the difference between them grew, and by the time she was ten, Paxton had already guessed that they had almost nothing in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was difficult to believe that they were even related. To her mother, her clubs were everything, her women friends, her auxiliaries, her bridge days, and benefits for the Daughters of the Civil War, her life with those women were&nbsp;&nbsp;what she lived for.&nbsp;&nbsp;She almost seemed uninterested when her husband came home, and she listened politely to what he said at the dinner table at night, but even Paxton noticed that her mother seemed almost bored by her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Carlton noticed it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he would never have admitted it to anyone, he felt the same chill emanating from his wife as Paxton had for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice Andrews was dutiful, loyal, organized, well-dressed, pleasant, polite, perfectly bred, and she had never felt a single emotion for anyone in her entire lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;She simply didn't have it in her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenie knew it, too, although she expressed it differently than Carlton would have, she'd long since said of her to her daughters that Beatrice Andrews's heart was colder and s...</p><h2>Secrets Of Droon Special Edition #3: Voyagers Of The Silver Sand</h2><p>With nearly 2 million books in print, this Little Apple series is H-O-T, hot.

Best known today for his creation of Topper, Smith&#39;s comic fantasy fiction (most of it involving sex, lots of drinking, and supernatural transformations, and aided by racy illustrations) sold millions of copies in the early 1930s. Smith drank as steadily as his characters; his appearance in James Thurber&#39;s The Years With Ross involves an unexplained week-long disappearance. Smith was born in Annapolis, Maryland the son of a Navy commodore, attended Dartmouth College, and after hungry years in Greenwich Village working part-time as an advertising agent, Smith achieved meteoric success with the publication of Topper in 1926. His other works include: The Stray Lamb (1929), Turnabout (1931), The Night Life of the Gods (1931), Topper Takes a Trip (1932), The Bishop&#39;s Jaegers (1932), Rain in the Doorway (1933), Skin and Bones (1933) and The Glorious Pool (1934).

Petroski's opening and closing chapters, "Imagine" and "Realize," remind us how a bridge starts out as a dream of engineering, but ends as a reality of compromise and maintenance.

Museum curator Cera (Jewels of Fantasy: Costume Jewelry of the 20th Century, LJ 9/1/93) offers the first book about Haskell's company, from 1924 to the present. Miriam Haskell jewelry was prized by movie stars and sold in exclusive boutiques. The provenance of early Haskell jewelry was difficult to ascertain, but an identifiable style emerged: the use of elaborate clusters of colorful elements handcrafted as imaginatively as Tiffany's. As the company grew, leading designers produced distinguished works, and they and their pieces are profiled here. Collectors will also appreciate the hundreds of full-color photographs. Loring, who has written several books on Tiffany style (Tiffany Parties, LJ 2/1/94), here celebrates 100 years of precious jewelry prized in the United States and abroad. Hundreds of brooches, bracelets, rings, earrings, necklaces, and accessories are shown in color against vintage photographs and drawings, including rare images from the Tiffany archives. Sometimes the busy backgrounds make the jewels difficult to see, but overall Loring provides a good overview. This and the Miriam Haskell volume prove that American creativity can be as rich as any. Design collections will have to have both, as will libraries where there is interest in jewelry as collecting.?Therese Duzinkiewicz Baker, Western Kentucky Univ.

The victim's family isn't convinced they have the right man, however, so they ask Th�ra Gudmundsd�ttir, attorney and single mother of two, to investigate. The fee is considerable&#x2014;more than enough to make things a bit easier for the struggling lawyer and her children.</p><p>It's not long before Th�ra and Matthew Reich, her new associate, discover something unusual about the deceased student: He had been obsessed with the country's grisly history of torture, execution, and witch hunts&#x2014;a topic made all the more peculiar by the fact that unlike witch hunts in other countries, those in Iceland had targeted men . . . not women.</p><p>As Th�ra and Matthew dig deeper, they make the connection between long-bygone customs and the student's murder. But the shadow of dark traditions conceals secrets in both the past and the present, and the investigators soon realize that nothing is as it seems . . . and that no one can be trusted.</p></p><p><p>Yrsa Sigurdard�ttir is an award-winning author of five children's novels and a division manager with one of Iceland's largest engineering firms. She lives with her family in Reykjav�k, Iceland.</p>Similar in plot to Swedish author Helene Tursten's The Glass Devil, this first in a new series from Icelandic author Sigurdardottir offers little readers have not seen before. As with Tursten's novel, the spectre of demon-worship is at the heart of the mystery, after the strangled corpse of Harald Guntlieb is discovered with his eyes gouged out. Guntlieb, a German student, was attending graduate school in Iceland, examining the latter country's history of witch-hunting, an academic pursuit that may have taken on more personal overtones. His grieving parents, who had already suffered the loss of a child, enlist attorney and single mother Th�ra Gudmundsd�ttir to objectively assess the police case against a drug addict arrested for the murder. Aided by an attractive ex-German police officer, Gudmundsd�ttir diligently tracks down the dead man's friends and colleagues, before arriving at the truth. The author gives less of a sense of her native land than other contemporary Scandinavian crime writers like Karin Fossum, and the identity of the killer will surprise few. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are no plot surprises; the authors have retained the basic story of an alien four-year-old child who is kidnapped from his time zone and brought into a future world. Yet this is a fresh and satisfying version, primarily because the characters have been made richer, the depiction of 21st-century society rounded out and the history of the Neanderthal tribe from which the eponymous boy was abducted more fully given. When the woebegone waif, now named Timmie, was snatched from his epoch, he was brought into a pool of no-time, which exists coincident with the present. Since Timmie is condemned to living within that pool forever, his presence raises moral questions: Is it abusive to leave him alone in this limbo for eternity? Would it be equally cruel to send him back to the Ice Age? Asimov ( Foundation ) and Silverberg ( Lord Valentine's Castle ) explore these issues in an intriguing story supported by seamless writing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Pastoral (MTI): American Trilogy (1) (Vintage International)</h2><p><b>Now a major motion picture!</b><br><br>Here is Philip Roth's masterpiece&#x2014;an elegy for the American&nbsp;century's promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss.

His prose is carefully controlled yet always fresh and intellectually subtle as he reconstructs the halcyon days, circa World War II, of Seymour &#34;the Swede&#34; Levov, a high school sports hero and all-around Great Guy who wants nothing more than to live in tranquillity. But as the Swede grows older and America crazier, history sweeps his family inexorably into its grip: His own daughter, Merry, commits an unpardonable act of &#34;protest&#34; against the Vietnam war that ultimately severs the Swede from any hope of happiness, family, or spiritual coherence.As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss.

Naylor's survey encompasses the Paleolithic period and early Egyptian cultures, leading readers through the pharonic dynasties, the conflicts with Rome and Carthage, the rise of Islam, the growth of the Ottoman Empire, European incursions, and the postcolonial prospects for Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Western Sahara.</p><p>Emphasizing the importance of encounters and interactions among civilizations, North Africa maps a prominent future for scholarship about this pivotal region.</p></p><p>PHILLIP C.

How interesting could <i>that</i> be? In the hands of talented Mary Walton, it is very interesting indeed. Walton spent more than two years inside the belly of the giant Ford Motor Company researching the manufacture of the 1996 Taurus, and her account makes for surprisingly entertaining reading. Walton, who has written extensively about management theory, brings a perceptive eye and a breezy style to her critique of the automobile industry. In addition to the redesign of Ford's popular model, Walton also examines the sometimes volatile relations between the company's engineering staff and its designers, criticizes Ford's hierarchical management structure, and questions the astounding number of upper-level executives recruited from the military and their resulting martial management style. <p> The private lives of Ford employees likewise do not escape Walton's critical eye. Twelve-hour days are common among Ford engineers, but the toll on their personal lives is high. So critical is Mary Walton of Ford's management practices that, upon seeing an early draft of <i>Car</i>, Ford revoked Walton's access to its top executives. For a book that provides both solid entertainment and an in-depth analysis of the auto industry, <i>Car</i> is the top of the line.</p>Mary Walton lives in Philadelphia.</p><h2>America Will Be!: Conversations on Hope, Freedom, and Democracy</h2><p>This illuminating dialogue between Buddhist leader Daisaku Ikeda&nbsp;and Vincent Harding, a friend and advisor to Martin Luther King, Jr.,&nbsp;recounts the historic events of the American civil rights movement, with an emphasis on the spiritual and philosophical values and ideas that they believe should guide all modern experiments in democracy.&nbsp;It sheds light on the contributions of major leaders such as King, Gandhi, and Obama, while also calling attention to the roles played by women and "ordinary people" in social justice struggles.&nbsp;Divided into 16 conversations, including chapters on character, encouragement, influence, and revolution,&nbsp;it&nbsp;reveals how&nbsp;the movement&#x2019;s victories expressed a profound vision of freedom and equality&nbsp;through nonviolent social change.

But what a day it was! <br>He had fame, money, women, and talent. He spent his golden years entertaining a flourishing and garishly happy Italy. His success stretched over borders and across the seas. But somewhere things began to go awry, the public's tastes in music first and foremost. His band is now a shadow of its former self and his life is fraught with mundane but infuriating complications. It's time to make a clean break with the past. Following a brief tour in Brazil, Tony decides to decamp and make a life for himself in South America. Here, his hyper- developed and very peculiar vision of the world, irreversibly shaped by those years in which he hobnobbed with Sinatra and enjoyed the adoration of audiences the world over, is under assault. Now that he has abandoned music the world strikes him as a barren place that is completely at odds with his understanding of it. Tony's story is the story of a worldwizened but yet strangely naive man forced to reconcile with life or lose himself entirely. Told in a breathless, irreverent first person voice that is as original as any in contemporary literature, Everybody's Right is the debut novel from one of Italy's most compelling and singular creative minds. Paolo Sorrentino, known principally as the director of movies considered to be among the finest examples of cinematic art by any Italian filmmaker in recent decades, here proves himself to be an equally formidable novelist.</p><p>Paolo Sorrentino's feature film directing debut came in 2001 with <i>One Man Up</i>, winner of the Nastro D'Argento for best young director. He achieved international recognition in 2004 for his stylish thriller, <i>The Consequences of Love</i>, nominated for the Palme D'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Sorrentino's most recent film is <i>Il Divo</i> (Prix du Jury at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival). <br><br><i>This Must Be the Place</i>, the story of a wealthy middle-aged rock star, will mark Sorrentino's English-language feature debut and stars two-time academy award winner Sean Penn. It will be released in 2011. <br><br><i>Everybody's Right</i>, nominated for Italy's most prestigious literary award, The Strega, is Sorrentino's first novel.</p><h2>Aunt Dimity Slays the Dragon (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p>Her eighth summer in the small English village of Finch happily brightened by the opening of a nearby Renaissance fair, Lori Shepherd finds the revelries shattered by dark undercurrents, including a madrigal singer&#39;s stalker, a knight&#39;s saboteur rival, and a would-be assassin who is targeting Good King Wilfred. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of eighteen other Aunt Dimity mysteries.

By the end of August, my peaceful English village would find itself at the mercy of rampaging brigands, bullies, braggarts, and blundering louts. There would also be an unexpected death.</p><p>None of us saw it coming. On the evening in question, my neighbors and I were sitting quietly&#x2014;some of us somnolently&#x2014;in the old schoolhouse that had for many years served as our village hall. We were there to attend a village affairs committee meeting, and nearly seventy of us had shown up because the annual May meeting was widely regarded as the most important committee meeting of the year.</p><p>The sole purpose of the May meeting was to finalize plans for Finch&#x2019;s many summer activities. It was, for the most part, an egregious waste of time, because everyone knew that the summer fete, the bring-and-buy sale, the gymkhana, the art show, the flower show, the dog show, and the tidy cottage competition would be run exactly as they had been run for as long as anyone could remember.</p><p>Innovations might be suggested, discussed, and debated, but they were never adopted. In the end, the same dates would be chosen and the same folding tables would be used, along with the same frayed linen tablecloths, tarnished tea urns, and increasingly shabby decorations. The summer fete would be held, as it had always been, at the vicarage, the gymkhana would take place at Anscombe Manor, and everything else&#x2014;apart from the tidy cottage competition&#x2014;would be staged, as per usual, in the schoolhouse. In the eight years since my husband and I had moved to Finch, the routine had never varied in the slightest.</p><p>The only thing that ever changed from one year to the next was the assignment of menial tasks to volunteers. The glamorous jobs had been snapped up as long ago as 1982 by women who would defend to the death their right to wear big hats and flowery frocks while opening the art show or graciously awarding ribbons at the gymkhana. Competition was understandably less fierce for the less glamorous jobs. No one fought for the right to iron tablecloths, empty rubbish bins, or pick bits of soggy crepe paper out of the grass on the village green. Since such toil was essential to the success of any event, however, volunteers had to be found.</p><p>It was left to our esteemed chairwoman, the all-powerful Peggy Taxman, to delegate the donkeywork, and it was for this reason, and this reason alone, that the May meeting was so very well attended. Peggy had it within her grasp to favor us with the pleasant chore of attending to the tea urns or to condemn us to the noxious duty of scrubbing the schoolhouse floor after the dog show. We were agog to learn our fates.</p><p>&#x201c;The meeting will come to order.&#x201d; Peggy banged her gavel, then pointed it accusingly at the room in general. &#x201c;And if I catch any of you napping, I&#x2019;ll have you removed from the schoolhouse!&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Barlow, who had already dozed off, woke with a start.</p><p>&#x201c;We done yet?&#x201d; he asked sleepily.</p><p>&#x201c;Just getting started,&#x201d; Miranda Morrow murmured from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Mr. Barlow yawned, rubbed his eyes, and lifted his gaze to the five committee members.</p><p>The members sat shoulder-to-shoulder on one side of the long, linen-draped table that had been set up on the small stage at the rear of the schoolhouse. Peggy Taxman occupied the middle chair, a position which allowed her to loom menacingly over the assembled throng. Lesser villagers perched meekly on folding chairs on either side of a central aisle leading to the schoolroom&#x2019;s double doors, through which Peggy would sweep magisterially after she&#x2019;d made her final pronouncement.</p><p>No one would dare to stop her or attempt to dispute her decisions. An empire-builder by nature, Peggy ran two major businesses as well as the post office in Finch. She was a woman of substance, both physically and financially, and her fierce sense of civic duty drove her to rule the village with an iron hand, a steely eye, and a voice like thunder. A reproving glance from behind those pointy, rhinestone-studded glasses was usually all it took to make the bravest among us quail. When the glance didn&#x2019;t work, she employed the voice, and although I&#x2019;d never seen the iron hand in action, I had no doubt that, if all else failed, she would use it.</p><p>The other committee members were much less daunting. Sally Pyne, vice chair and tearoom owner, preferred gossip to governing and was content to let Peggy rule the roost. George Wetherhead, recording secretary and model train enthusiast, was so bashful that he rarely raised his eyes from the laptop computer he used to record the minutes. Mr. Wetherhead would no more think of contradicting Peggy than he would of challenging her to a wrestling match.</p><p>Our treasurer, Jasper Taxman, had been a retired accountant before marriage to our chairwoman had forced him to rethink his definition of retirement. No professional career could have kept him busier than his wife did. When he wasn&#x2019;t minding the tills in Peggy&#x2019;s shops or selling stamps in Peggy&#x2019;s post office, he was keeping the books for Peggy&#x2019;s myriad committees.</p><p>The last chair on the stage was assigned to the least important member of the committee: me, Lori Shepherd&#x2014;wife, mother, and hapless draftee. I sat at the long table because, having made the grave mistake of missing last year&#x2019;s May meeting, I&#x2019;d been appointed, in absentia, to the post of sergeant-at-arms.</p><p>All things considered, I&#x2019;d gotten off lightly. Although my title was impressive, my duties were not. I was assigned to keep order among the villagers during the meeting, and to distribute Peggy&#x2019;s work rosters after it. Since our chairwoman needed no one&#x2019;s help to keep the villagers in order, and since she wouldn&#x2019;t release the rosters until she&#x2019;d finished reviewing her copious notes, I spent most of the evening staring absently into space.</p><p>&#x201c;Item one,&#x201d; Peggy began. &#x201c;A few comments on fastening floral swags to the art show tables. Safety pins are considered unsightly and will not be used unless the following conditions apply. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>As if by magic, my eyes stayed open while my mind floated out of the schoolhouse. My first thoughts were, as always, of home. Finch was nestled snugly in a verdant river valley set amidst the patchwork fields and rolling hills of the Cotswolds, a rural region in England&#x2019;s West Midlands. I lived two miles south of Finch, in a cottage made of honey-colored stone, with my husband, Bill, and our six-year-old identical twin sons, Will and Rob.</p><p>Although Bill, the twins, and I were American, we&#x2019;d lived in England long enough to know the difference between cr�me fra�che and clotted cream, and to develop an incurable addiction to the latter. Bill ran the European branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable Boston law firm from a high-tech office on the village green, Will and Rob attended school in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping, and I divided my time between taking care of my family and serving my community.</p><p>Until quite recently, we&#x2019;d shared our home with the boys&#x2019; nanny, the inestimable Annelise Sciaparelli, but she&#x2019;d left us in mid-May to marry her longtime fianc�, Oliver Elstyn, and her room had been vacant ever since. With the twins attending primary school full-time, neither Bill nor I felt the need to hire another nanny, and we agreed that Annelise was irreplaceable in any case.</p><p>&#x201c;Item twenty-four . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Peggy&#x2019;s bellow jerked me out of my reverie.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . the proper use of dust bin lids!&#x201d;</p><p>I immediately sank back into a stupor shared by almost everyone in the schoolhouse. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time I&#x2019;d been excited about a committee meeting. My life was in many ways idyllic&#x2014;devoted husband, healthy sons, happy home&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d lately begun to realize that it was also just a tiny bit . . . boring. I loved my friends and neighbors&#x2014;most of the time&#x2014;but their faces had started to become a tad too familiar, their habits slightly too predictable. The daily routine of village life, which I&#x2019;d once found so fulfilling, had recently begun to seem a little too . . . routine.</p><p>As I scanned the faces assembled in the schoolroom, I acknowledged sadly that there wasn&#x2019;t much I didn&#x2019;t know about my fellow villagers. Mr. Barlow, a retired mechanic, was in the midst of cleaning the carburetor in a vintage Mustang he was restoring for a wealthy and recently divorced client who lived in Tewkesbury. Although Miranda Morrow was a strict vegetarian, she spent hours every day preparing the choicest cuts of meat for her cat. Lilian Bunting, the vicar&#x2019;s wife, was currently rewriting the third paragraph of her introduction to a book about stained glass. Dick Peacock, the local publican, had taken up pottery as a hobby, but the consensus was that his handmade goblets would do little to improve the taste of his homemade wine.</p><p>And so on and so forth. I knew without asking whose dog had fleas, whose roof had sprung a leak, whose grandchildren were angelic and whose were not. If Finch had any surprises left for me, it was keeping them well hidden.</p><p>&#x201c;Item twenty-five: Flower show entry forms. Block letters must be used when filling out . . .&#x201d;</p><p>While Peggy continued to drone, my gaze traveled to the portrait of the queen, hung in a place of honor above the schoolroom&#x2019;s double doors. I usually felt a small, Anglophilic tingle when I beheld England&#x2019;s gracious monarch decked out in royal regalia, but I&#x2019;d seen the schoolroom portrait so often that it no longer worked its magic.</p><p>Sighing, I looked down at my idle hands. If asked, I would have been forced to confess that I had no one but myself to blame for my growing sense of ennui. After the fiasco with the vampire in October, I&#x2019;d sworn to keep my feet firmly on the ground, and on the ground I&#x2019;d kept them for seven months, successfully stifling an inborn and nearly irresistible inclination to let my vivid imagination run away with me.</p><p>When Sally Pyne&#x2019;s gilded antique biscuit barrel had gone missing in January, I&#x2019;d clamped down on my desire to nab the thief and left it to Sally to remember&#x2014;two days later&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d loaned her precious barrel to Mr. Barlow, who&#x2019;d played one of the Three Wise Men in the Nativity play and needed a fancy container for the frankincense.</p><p>Similarly, when a stranger spent a cold February morning taking photographs of every nook and cranny in Finch, I <i>did not</i> allow myself to envision him as a predatory land developer, a fast-talking film location scout, or a devious foreign spy, and when I learned that he was, in fact, a real estate agent acting on behalf of clients who were about to buy long-vacant Crabtree Cottage, I <i>refused</i> to wonder whether or not those clients had sinister ties to the woman who&#x2019;d died there.</p><p>It was just as well, because the clients turned out to be Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham, who were sitting just below me, in the front row of folding chairs. The newest residents of Crabtree Cottage were a perfectly friendly pair of middle-aged art appraisers who&#x2019;d never heard of Prunella Hooper or her tragic demise, and who were so eager to fit into their new community that they&#x2019;d actually <i>volunteered</i> to clean up after the bring-and-buy sale. As I surveyed their shining faces, I thought pityingly, <i>They&#x2019;ll learn</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . cacti and succulents belong to separate and distinct plant categories and will be judged accordingly, with no exceptions. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>My mind drifted lazily from cacti to flowers to the beautiful bouquet Annelise had ...</p></p><h2>Walking Home From Mongolia: Ten Million Steps Through China, From the Gobi Desert to the South China Sea</h2><p><p>Starting in the Gobi desert in winter, adventurer Rob Lilwall sets out on an extraordinary six-month journey, walking almost 5000 kilometres across China.

Mack powerfully demonstrates how the alien abduction phenomenon calls for a revolutionary new way of examining the nature of reality and our place in the cosmos.<br><br>Harvard professor Mack stunned the world when he published the astonishing results of his extensive research involving clients who claimed they had had encounters with alien life-forms. Writing with the authority and insight that have marked his distinguished career as a psychiatrist and writer, Mack used the remarkable stories to show how the abduction phenomenon has the vast potential to transform the foundation of human thought. In <b>Passport to the Cosmos</b>, Mack, who has done additional research with abductees in the United States and around the world, provocatively asserts that this phenomenon is part of a new age in human consciousness, a time in which we must be willing to embrace the idea that alien visitation is real on some level. Drawing on the rich tradition of non-Western and indigenous cultures, which are more accepting of the idea that we live in a multidimensional universe, Mack persuasively shows that by broadening our definition of "what is real" we can begin to explore a phenomenon that has deep and lasting implications for humanity.<br><br>In <b>Passport to the Cosmos</b>, John Mack further solidifies his reputation as a brave pioneer on the forefront of the science of human experience with an authoritative voice that takes us into the twenty-first century.</p><p>"Such a profound and beautiful existence is this world we live in, and how much more wondrous to truly know that not only are we not alone, we're really not alone."<br>-- Karin, an experiencer, to John MackJohn E.

"When I'm tickled PINK,/It means I'm feeling dandy./Everything is great and/As sweet as cotton candy." The comparisons are predictable: red/angry, green/jealous, blue/sad, but suit the intended audience. Parton also encourages empathy ("So remember as you go/from hue to hue/That each and every person/Has feelings too") and self-control ("It's not/always up to you,/The way that you feel./But/how you act,/<i>Is</i> a different deal")&#x2014;important concepts for this age group.

But he has also made enemies among the rulers in Jerusalem, who fear his power and his influence and who have conspired to put an end to him by whatever means possible. Mordechai ben Uzziel's life couldn't be any worse. His daughter, Miriam, has vanished from Rome, spirited away by none other than his old nemesis &#x2014; Simeon ben David. Meanwhile, Mordechai's credibility with the Sanhedrin is jeopardized when the council learns that his own daughter has become a disciple of this so-called Messiah. Simeon ben David's life couldn't be any better. After struggling to follow the Savior and to testify of his knowledge that Jesus is the Son of God, Simeon has found peace and joy in following the Master. More than that, he has found love; he and Miriam will be betrothed before the feast of Hanukkah. The family of David ben Joseph continues to follow Jesus, though the Savior's teachings now carry an undercurrent of sorrow and unsettling prophecy. And despite increasing danger, Jesus' ministry draws him inexorably toward Jerusalem. Along the way, Jesus performs miracles of astounding power; healing a woman afflicted for almost two decades, restoring sight to a man born blind, and raising Lazarus after four days in the grave. But not everyone is thrilled to hear Jesus declare, "I am the light of the world; I am the bread of life" during the Feast of the Tabernacles. As the end of Jesus' ministry &#x2014; and his life &#x2014; approaches, the lines are swiftly and solidly drawn between those who will stand for Jesus and those who will tear him down. The final volume of The Kingdom and the Crown series, , details the last week of Jesus' life &#x2014; his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the spiritually fulfilling Last Supper, and the crowning achievement of the atonement that begins in the Garden of Gethsemane and culminates in the Garden Tomb. In The Kingdom and the Crown trilogy, Gerald N. Lund has given us the chance to behold the man known as Jesus of Nazareth, to experience what it must have been like to walk and talk with the Master.</p><p>In this fast paced and sweeping epic, Lund portrays both fictional and historical characters who have a variety of responses to Christ&#39;s teachings. Seasoned with authentic details about the history, culture, and politics of that extraordinary era.Gerald N.

For better or for worse, the instruction manual for today's world is written by lawyers. Everyone needs to understand this manual--but lawyers persist in writing it in language no one can possibly decipher.<br>Why accuse someone of making "material misstatements of fact," when you could just call them a liar? What's the point of a "last" will and testament if, presumably, every will is your last? Did you know that "law" derives from a Norse term meaning "that which is laid down"? So tell your boss to stop laying down the law--it already is.<br>The debate over Plain vs. Precision English rages on in courtrooms, boardrooms, and, yes, even bedrooms. Here, Adam Freedman explores the origins of legalese, interprets archaic phrasing (witnesseth!), explains obscure and oddly named laws, and disputes the notion that lawyers are any smarter than the rest of us when judged solely on their briefs. (A brief, by the way, is never so.)</p><p>Adam Freedman writes the "Legal Lingo" column for the <i>New York Law Journal Magazine</i>, and was a litigator before joining a major investment bank where he earns his living decoding policies and procedures into plain English.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.The Party of the First Part<br>1THE GLORY OF LEGALESE<i>"Incorporeal" means "without a body." However, when a company is "incorporated" it is given a body.</i>--CENTRE FOR PLAIN LEGAL LANGUAGE, 1995At 2:30 A.M. on March 22, 1997, a convicted felon named Anthony Dye was racing his Corvette through the streets of Elkhart, Indiana. The police were in hot pursuit. Dye pulled into his mother's driveway, got out of the car, and made a run for it. When the police caught up with him, Dye took a semiautomatic pistol from his waistband and opened fire. At that critical moment, a valiant police dog named Frei leapt into action, fastened onto Dye's leg, and, as it were, took a bite out of crime. Dye was arrested.Having been injured in the course of his arrest, Dye did what any red-blooded American would do. He brought a lawsuit--against Frei the police dog. Dye argued that dogs are "persons" who can be sued, at least when they work for the police. Dye fought his way to the second highest court in the land, the United States Court of Appeals, which dismissed his claim.Dye's theory that a dog is a person is not as far-fetched as you might think. In fact, he wasn't even the first person to sue a police dog. And some very respectable lawyers have argued that the legal definition of person ought to be expanded, at least to include other primates. Laurence Tribe, Harvard's leading constitutional scholar, has maintained for years that chimpanzees should be considered persons under the Constitution.That the country's best legal minds can be consumed with questions about whether the word "person" includes dogs or chimpanzees tells us a lot about lawyers. But it also tells us something about the <i>language</i> of the law. Nothing in the realm of legalese is quite what it seems.Consider the fact that Congress once passed legislation declaring that "September 16, 1940 means June 27, 1950." In New Zealand, the law says that a "day" means a period of seventy-two hours, while an Australian statute defines "citrus fruit" to include eggs. To American lawyers, a twenty-year-old document is "ancient," while a seventeen-year-old person is an "infant." At one time or another, the law has defined "dead person" to include nuns, "daughter" to include son, and "cow" to include horse; it has even declared white to be black.At times, legalese appears to be almost willfully perverse. Standard legal agreements, for example, typically contain some version of the following clause:The masculine shall include the feminine, the singular shall include the plural, and the present tense shall include the past and future tenses.In other words, the law sees absolutely no difference between "the boy becomes a man" and "girls will be girls."Well, then. All this would be of purely academic interest if it weren't for the fact that legal documents are part of the basic infrastructure of life. Isn't it odd that the most important events in our lives require slogging through language that almost nobody understands?Think about it: getting married or divorced, buying or renting property, investing a nest egg, making a will, serving on a jury, declaring bankruptcy, taking out insurance, borrowing money, getting sued, undergoing surgery--each one of these transactions involves lengthy documents that we are expected to sign, usually without having had sufficient time to read them. Indeed, a person who insistson reading everything that he signs is regarded as a crank of the first order.And yet, if you ask an educated person, he will often tell you, in self-satisfied tones, that he would never sign a document that he hadn't read. "Wouldn't dream of it," he'll say, perhaps tugging at his bow tie and straightening his horn-rimmed glasses, "I won't agree to anything unless I have time to read it over."Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don't believe this hypothetical educated person. Does he actually read every car rental contract in full? Does he pore over every agreement sent to him by a credit card company, and the warranty on every product that he buys? Does he read every software licensing agreement before clicking "I agree"? If the answer to all of these is "yes," then I dare say he also lines his hat with aluminum foil.Consider the case of Justin Noe, a British motorist who was pulled over by the police in 1999 and asked to submit to a Breathalyzer test. He agreed, but on the condition that he first be allowed to consult the Police and Criminal Evidence Act; that is, the very law that explains a citizen's rights when taking Breathalyzer tests. A court later decided that Noe's request was so patently unreasonable as to constitute a refusal to submit to the test, the implication being that he was probably drunk. Clearly, anybody who asks to read a statute must be intoxicated.When nonlawyers do manage to read legal documents, they typically end up more confused than they were before they started. Any language in which libel can mean either a disparaging remark or a lawsuit against a ship is obviously a disaster waiting to happen. In legalese, when you executean agreement, you bring it into existence; but when you execute a person, you do just the opposite. A layman is often surprised to learn that only land and buildings count as real property, as though things like cars and furniture were somehow <i>un</i>real property. Actually, the "real" in real property comes from the French word for "royal," because all land used to be held by the king. There, doesn't that make you feel better?The double and triple meanings of legal language account for many of the odd newspaper headlines that make the rounds on the Internet--"Man struck by lightning faces battery charge," for example. Or "Juvenile court to try shooting defendant." Now <i>there's</i> an idea.MIND THE GAPIn 2001, the <i>Economist</i> magazine reported on a "worrying gap" between the language of the public and that of the legal profession. That gap grows wider every day, as legal English staunchly resists the changes rippling through everyday English. On the bright side, this means that the law is less susceptible to silly fads--lawyers don't write things like "gr8--cu 18r!"--but it also means that the law is less and less accessible to each new generation.Legalese could even evolve into a foreign language in the not-too-distant future. Already, many linguists refer to the language of law as a "sublanguage," meaning that it's more than just a collection of jargon, but also has its own specialized rules of grammar and syntax. How many ordinary English speakers understand the common mortgage term that asks you to promise that you are "lawfully seisedof the estate to be conveyed"? Or the promissory note that makes you waive your right to "interpose any counterclaim"? Sublanguage indeed.The fact that legalese is drifting away from everyday language is especially sad since the story of legal English is, in many ways, the story of the English language itself. There are statutes recorded in English going back to the Laws of Ine, the Anglo-Saxon king of Wessex, in the late seventh century A.D. Ine's laws were admirably straightforward. For example:If anyone steals so that his wife and children do not know, let him pay sixty shillings fine. If he should steal with the knowledge of his family, then they should all go into slavery.What could be clearer? For centuries, legal language played a decisive role in the development of English. The very first dictionary printed in England (in 1523) was a law dictionary written by John Rastell, a true Renaissance man who at various times was a playwright, theatrical producer, printer, translator, failed explorer, and, of course, lawyer. The first English-language dictionary to include word etymologies was also a law dictionary, Thomas Blount's 1670 <i>Nomo-Lexikon</i>.In 1607, lawyer John Cowell came out with a massive dictionary called <i>The Interpreter</i>. The book was intended as a legal glossary, but such was Cowell's enthusiasm for words that he could not help veering off topic, defining such nonlegal words as cinnamon, condor, fodder, and pier, not to mention polein (the pointy tip of a boot) and senie (a medicinal herb).One of the great pleasures of perusing old law dictionaries is the glimpse we get of a vanished society. In Cowell's book we see the sturdy shyreeve, the "shire reeve," a local constable, whose title would eventually morph into sheriff. There are markets and staples , places where merchants could bring their goods--hence our use of the word "staple" to mean a basic commodity. Best of all, there is the ale-tastor: "an officer sworn to look to ... the goodness of bread and ale or beer." A tough job, but somebody had to do it.One also can't help but admire Cowell's use of certain obsolete terms that are long overdue for a revival. The Anglo-Saxon terms backberond (a thief caught carrying pilfered goods on his back) and miskenning (misspeaking in court) would both prove highly useful today. The dulcet word hoghenhine, which denotes a houseguest who stays more than two nights, after which the host must either evict him or become legally responsible for him, would come in handy around the holidays. And how impoverished is our language--if not our economy--without a coin known as a Gallihalpens?Cowell was a contemporary of Shakespeare, who was himself so addicted to legal jargon that many scholars believe that the dramatist practiced, or at least studied, law in his youth. Tucked away in the Bard's many plays and sonnets are dozens of legal terms, including pleading, plaintiff, defendant, appellant, and jury, to name just a few. Shakespeare's Sonnet 46, for example, depicts an imaginary lawsuit between the author's eye and his heart for possession of a beloved woman. Here we get both plead and plea, defendant, title, quest (short for inquest, or jury), impaneled, and verdict. The sonnet concludes with the jurygiving each party a moiety (a half interest): namely, the eye gets the beloved's outward beauty while the heart gets her inner love.Legal English, like English itself, emerged from a melting pot of languages, including Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, and Church Latin. The word law is Norse in origin, a legacy of the Viking raids that led to permanent settlements in northern England. The word originally meant "that which is laid down," so don't bother laying down the law--it already is.As one seventeenth-century observer noted, the laws of England "are as mixt as our language, compounded of British, Roman, Saxon, Danish [and] Norman customs. And as our language is so much the richer, so the laws are the more complete."CROSSING THE PONDIn the early United States, the link between law and language was as strong as it had been in England. The patriarch of all American dictionaries, Noah Webster (1758-1843), was a lawyer, although not particularly successful at that profession. His great contribution lay in the realization that America needed to declare its linguistic independence--especially when it came to legal language. In 1800 the leading British dictionary defined escheat (forfeiture of property to the state) as follows:Any lands, or other profits, that fall to a lord within his manor by forfeiture, or the death of his tenant, dying without heir general or especial.Lord? Manor? That would hardly do for a republic. Webster stripped away the aristocratic verbiage to give us a democratic escheat: "The falling of lands to the owner or to the state by forfeiture or failure of heirs."Webster cleaned up references to the Crown from other legal terms, approved such innovations as using deed as a verb, and introduced crucial American usages like constitutionality, a word first attributed to Alexander Hamilton. In all, Webster devoted more than twenty-five years to his dictionary, including two years of research in England. It remains a towering work of scholarship.It would be nice to think of Webster as a kind, scholarly man in a fuzzy cardigan. Unfortunately, history remembers him as a "severe, correct, humorless, religious, temperate man who was not easy to like, even by other severe, religious, temperate, humorless people." It was not enough for Webster to produce a dictionary--the ex-lawyer wanted his definitions to have the backing of <i>law.</i> He pressed then--Chief Justice John Marshall to adopt his dictionary as the official dictionary of the Supreme Court. Marshall declined.America soon had its own purpose-built law dictionaries, no thanks to Webster. The first, published in 1839, was the product of the French-born John Bouvier. Scores of competing dictionaries followed, including the most famous American law lexicon, <i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> first published in 1891 and still in print today.Nothing better illustrates American law's obsession with language than a series of books with the unassuming name <i>Words and Phrases.</i> Each page of <i>Words and Phrases</i> contains upward of twenty brief summaries of court decisionson the legal meaning of various, well, words and phrases. Each book in the series has about 800 pages, and there are 118 books. The entry for shall--not an especially ambiguous word, one might think--runs to 93 pages, citing more than twelve hundred cases.TODAY'S LEGALESEBy the 1960s, the late Professor David Mellinkoff, a renowned authority on legal language, could state without exaggeration that "no profession of words has a longer history of practical effort devoted to refining language."The results of all that refinement have been decidedly mixed. Remember the elegant law of King Ine? Well, thirteen hundred years later, British lawmakers have been reduced to writing statutes that say: "The hours of non-hours work worked by a worker in a pay reference period shall be the total of the number of hours spent by him during the pay reference period."But that's nothing. When British regulators turned their attention to the subject of <i>nuts,</i> they produced a sentence of almost sublime absurdity:In the Nuts (unground)(other than Ground Nuts) Order the expression "nuts" shall have reference to such nuts, other than ground nuts, as would but for this amending Order not qualify as nuts (unground) (other than ground nuts) by reason of their being nuts (unground).Meanwhile, in sunny Australia, a recent immigration law declares that "prescribed decisions of the Secretary [maybe] reviewed by prescribed review officers on application, as prescribed, by prescribed persons." Perhaps the person who wrote <i>that</i> sentence needs a prescription.The United States fares no better at writing laws. Taking a random page from the Code of Federal Regulations, one finds this bewildering pronouncement from the IRS:The fact that it may be difficult or impossible to provide a benefit, right, or feature described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section under a plan of a different type than the plan or plans under which it is provided is one of the factors taken into account in determining whether the plan satisfies the effective availability requirement of �1.401(a)(4)-4 (c)(1).To which one can only say: Oh dear, is that the time?We instinctively know legalese when we see it, but defining it is another matter. Certain traits of legal language seem obvious once you know them.

Now that most of us consider i-D a household name, it's interesting to be reminded that 20 years ago, street fashion was a nascent concept.

Journalistic in spirit and revolutionary in form, the magazine sought to show the world the gritty, real side of fashion as seen in the streets of London- kilts, mohawks, safety pins and all. When newsagents hesitated to sell i-D because of finger injuries resulting from the staples, early supporters helped by selling issues from the trunk of a Cadillac. Lots of teamwork and innovation brought i-D to the forefront of contemporary fashion culture and today it can be found at newsstands practically everywhere on the globe (minus the staples). </p><p>Smile i-D incorporates a single spread from each issue of the magazine thus far.

American journalist Christopher Lucas is investigating religious fanatics when he discovers a plot to bomb the sacred Temple Mount. A violent confrontation in the Gaza Strip, a race through riot-filled streets, a cat-and-mouse game in an underground maze -- as Lucas follows his leads, he uncovers an attempt to seize political advantage that reveals duplicity and depravity on all sides of Jerusalem's sacred struggle. <br> Ambitious, passionate, darkly comic, <i>Damascus Gate</i> is not only Robert Stone's biggest and best novel to date, but a timely and brilliant story of belief, power, salvation, and apocalypse.</p><p>In his earlier novels, Robert Stone has taken us to such hot spots as Vietnam, Central America, and that ultimate sinkhole of depravity we call Hollywood. This time around, it's Jerusalem. Given Stone's gift for depicting both political and personal embroilment--indeed, for making the two inextricable--this particular city is an inspired choice. For starters, Jerusalem remains a sacred destination for Muslims, Jews, and Christians and a hotly contested one. It's also a magnet for hustlers, fanatics, and millennial dreamers, a generous assortment of whom populate the pages of <i>Damascus Gate</i>. As always, Stone introduces a (relatively) innocent American into the picture--a journalist named Christopher Lucas. This career skeptic prides himself on his detachment: he prefers the kind of story "that exposed depravity and duplicity on both sides of supposedly uncompromising sacred struggles. He found such stories reassuring, an affirmation of the universal human spirit." Yet Lucas, a lapsed Catholic, has journeyed to Jerusalem at least in part to recharge his devotional batteries. And as he's slowly drawn into a terrorist plot--which involves drugs, arms smuggling, and a plan to blow up the Temple Mount--Lucas sheds his detachment in a hurry. Stone's novel functions as an expert thriller, whose slow, somewhat clunky wind-up is more than compensated for by a brilliant grand finale. It is also, however, a dogged exploration of faith, in which cynics and true believers jostle for predominance. "Life was so self-conscious in Jerusalem," the author reflects, "so lived at close quarters, by competing moralizers. Every little blessing demanded immediate record." It's hard to imagine a more vivid record of these mutual blessings--and maledictions!--than Robert Stone's.Touchstone PB 1999 * Previous ISBN 978-0-684-85911-8</p><h2>Holy Bible, King James Version</h2><p><p>The King James Version from Zondervan is now available in an easily readable pew Bible.

By turns caustic and compassionate, written with sardonic wit but displaying a passionate sympathy, this novel of splendid characters and emotionally charged events fully deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.%</p></p><p><i>"The first sign of trouble at Krishnapur came with a mysterious distribution of chapatis, made of coarse flour and about the size and thickness of a biscuit; towards the end of February 1857, they swept the countryside like an epidemic."</i> <p> Students of history will recognize 1857 as the year of the Sepoy rebellion in India--an uprising of native soldiers against the British, brought on by Hindu and Muslim recruits' belief that the rifle cartridges they were provided had been greased with pig or cow fat. This seminal event in Anglo-Indian relations provides the backdrop for J.G. Farrell's Booker Prize-winning exploration of race, culture, and class, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i>. </p><p> Like the mysteriously appearing chapatis, life in British India seems, on the surface, innocuous enough. Farrell introduces us gradually to a large cast of characters as he paints a vivid portrait of the Victorians' daily routines that are accompanied by heat, boredom, class consciousness, and the pursuit of genteel pastimes intended for cooler climates. Even the siege begins slowly, with disquieting news of massacres in cities far away. When Krishnapur itself is finally attacked, the Europeans withdraw inside the grounds of the Residency where very soon conditions begin to deteriorate: food and water run out, disease is rampant, people begin to go a little mad. Soon the very proper British are reduced to eating insects and consorting across class lines. Farrell's descriptions of life inside the Residency are simultaneously horrifying and blackly humorous. The siege, for example, is conducted under the avid eyes of the local populace, who clearly anticipate an enjoyable massacre and thus arrive every morning laden with picnic lunches (plainly visible to the starving Europeans). By turns witty and compassionate, <i>The Siege of Krishnapur</i> comprises the best of all fictional worlds: unforgettable characters, an epic adventure, and at its heart a cultural clash for the ages. Quite simply, this is a splendid novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>J.G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 and spent a good deal of his life abroad, including periods in France and North America, and then settled in London where he wrote most of his novels.Among his novels, TROUBLES won the Faber Memorial Prize in 1970 and the Lost Man Booker prize in 2010 and THE SIEGE OF KRISHNAPUR won the Booker Prize in 1973.In April 1979 he went to live in County Cork where only four months later he was drowned in a fishing accident.</p><h2>Something Borrowed</h2><p><i>Something Borrowed</i> tells the story of Rachel, a young attorney living and working in Manhattan.

A graduate of Wake Forest University and the University of Virginia School of Law, she lives in Atlanta with her family. </b></p> <p><b>Kristin Hannah (right) is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eighteen novels, including <i>Winter Garden</i>. She is a former lawyer turned writer and the mother of one son. She and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.</b></p> <p><b>Kristin Hannah:</b> Well, first, I have to say, Emily, that I am just the tiniest bit irritated with you. When I got the call to do this interview, I was thrilled, to say the least. It came at a really busy time for me--right after the holidays and we all know how crazy that is--and my work in progress was giving me fits. Then I picked up <i>Heart of the Matter</i>, and lost myself. No more writing, no more cooking, no getting my hair done or reading my email. Once I started the story I literally couldn't put it down. Brava, girlfriend, I say. Your characters are so real and compelling, and they always say exactly the right thing. With so much honest emotion, I just have to ask how much of your work comes from your own life? </p> <p><b>Emily Giffin:</b> It never fails to thrill me when someone responds to one of my novels--especially when it's another writer. Writers understand the alchemy involved in making up something from nothing. And I just finished your book, <i>Night Road</i>, and I found it so emotional, so moving, and so terrifying--especially since I have three young children who will someday be teenagers. In terms of how much does my work come from my own life, I would say that I'm absolutely inspired by people, places, conversations, relationships, and issues that I observe, and that the "what if" part of my novel is very much inspired by these things in my life. But the details of my plots and the specifics of my characters come from my own head. How about you, Kristin? I'll ask you the million-dollar question that every author gets asked: where do you get your ideas? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Ah, the idea question. I don't want to sound coy, but the truth is, I don't quite know. It's the most magical part of the process for me. I'm a pretty analytical gal, and I approach writing in the same just-the-facts-ma'am way I approach most things. I need to find an issue that engages me on an intellectual level, and then I need to marry that curiosity with a kind of passion. I need to feel genuinely passionate about each story before I ever write a word, and I have to actually have something to say. It takes me at least a year to research and write a novel, and so I have to really adore each part of it--the characters, setting, story. Most of all, it has to make me feel something genuine. That's really the most important component. Usually it begins with a single "what if" question--what if you discovered your mother had a whole secret life about which you knew nothing (<i>Winter Garden</i>) or what if your husband were accused of a crime you believed he hadn't committed (<i>True Colors</i>)--and then I write and re-write until the characters seem as real to me as old friends.</p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> I'm amazed by how much we have in common. We're both moms, both lawyers, both lived in London for a time. You're like a younger, cooler version of me. How did you make the transition from lawyer to writer, and do you think you'll ever practice law again? </p> <p><b>Emily:</b> I would hardly say I'm cooler than you, Kristin! I hear you live in Hawaii part time! What is cooler than that? I made the transition from lawyer to writer because I was so miserable being a lawyer that I needed some escape from the day-to-day of it. And inventing stories was that escape. I can say, without hesitation, that I will never practice law again. Would you? What kind of law did you practice, and for how long? What did you find appealing (or discouraging) about law? Did you find that it gave you fodder for any of your novels? </p> <p><b>Kristin:</b> Honestly, I have met very few lawyers who don't say that what they really want to do is write. Like you, I can say with certainty that I will never practice law again. Not that anyone would want me to. But I still keep my Bar membership up...just in case this whole writing thing doesn't work out. And yes, in the past few years, I have finally begun to put some of that law school education to work for me. I find that I'm really enjoying adding legal issues to my work. Of course, I have to talk to <i>real</i> lawyers to make sure I'm getting it right... </p> Read more of the conversation between Emily Giffin and Kristin Hannah <br><br>Everyone is raving about Emily Giffin and <i>Something Borrowed</i>! <br><br>"Emily Giffin brings a fresh, new voice to women's fiction. Something Borrowed is a deftly written and convincing tale of a friendship gone comically---and at times poignantly---awry." <br>- Meg Cabot, author of <i>The Boy Next Door</i> and <i>The Princess Diaries</i><br><br>"<i>Something Borrowed</i> is a winner; it has rare emotional depth. In <i>Something Borrowed</i>, Rachel, a perpetually self-sacrificing nice girl, shocks herself by launching an affair with her best friend's fianc�. This first blow for freedom sets off a chain reaction that will inspire pathologically nice girls everywhere to strike blows of their own." <br>- Valerie Frankel, author of <i>The Accidental Virgin</i> <br><br>"<i>Something Borrowed</i> by Emily Giffin is a luxurious page-turner of a debut novel that marks the arrival of a tremendously bright, clever new voice in women's fiction. In quick-moving, captivating prose punctuated with dead-on dialogue, Giffin deftly captures the complications and humor of love, betrayal, career, and friendship for a city girl at the edge of thirty; you forget this is just a novel and won't want to put it down." <br>- Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, author of <i>The Dirty Girls Social Club</i> and <i>Playing with Boys</i><br><br>"I absolutely loved it and read it in two sittings because I could not put it down. It was amazing to me how Emily handled this complex moral issue with such compassion and clear-sightedness. I believed it all the way and forgot about the rest of my life while I was immersed in it. Her three main characters are portrayed as multifaceted and endearingly flawed---just like real human beings. Something Borrowed is also very well written---nice, spare prose, which kept me pressing forward, agog to know what happened. This is a book which takes a clear-eyed look at the rivalry that exists in even the best of friendships. Congratulations to Emily on having written such a compelling, engrossing, and uplifting book." <br>- Marian Keyes, author of <i>Sushi for Beginners</i><br></p><h2>Kirsten Snowbound (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>In 1854, Kirsten and her cousins look after the farm while the adults go to town for supplies and everything is fine--until a blizzard surprises them.</p><p></p><h2>Duesenberg Aircraft Engines: A Technical Description</h2><p>The Duesenberg name became legendary in early auto racing and is now known around the world as one of the most sought after classic cars.

The cloudless blue sky, warm sunshine and dust-free easterly breeze were responsible, banishing, if only for a few minutes, the grim anxiety that filled their waking hours. For the moment the occasional rattle of a distant machine-gun, the odd boom of a tank cannon or gun, could be ignored.<br><br>About five kilometres behind them, the Seelow Heights fell sharply away to the Oderbruch, the meadowlands which lay between the escarpment and the Oder River. Soon&#x2014;in a few days, most likely&#x2014;the men and tanks of the Red Army would storm across those meadows and throw themselves at the German defences. The Russians would die in their thousands, but thousands more would follow. It would only be a matter of time. But a sunny day was a sunny day, with a power all its own. The two men were approaching the first houses of the small town when they came upon a large group of soldiers spread out along the side of the road. Few looked older than fifteen, and one boy was actually passing round his army-issue bag of sweets, as if he were at a friend&#x2019;s birthday party. Most had their panzerfausts lying beside them on the grass, and all looked exhausted&#x2014;the disposable rocket-launchers were a crippling weight for all but the strongest children. Their troop leader, who was probably almost out of his teens, was examining a weeping blister on one of his charges&#x2019; feet. As Paul and Gerhard walked past he looked up, and offered them a brief rueful smile.<br><br>Almost all of Diedersdorf &#x2019;s usual residents had left or been evacuated, and were now presumably clogging the roads leading westward, but the town was not being neglected&#x2014;in the small central square an over-zealous staff-sergeant was supervising another band of young recruits in sweeping the cobbles.<br><br>&#x2018;The madness of the military mind,&#x2019; Gerhard muttered, not for the first time.<br><br>As if to prove his point, a half-track drove across the square, sending eddies of dust in every direction. The sergeant endured a violent fit of coughing, then ordered his boys back to work.<br><br>The division mechanics had set up shop in the goods yard of the town station, close to where a large dug-out had been excavated in the railway embankment for the battalion command post. The corporal at the improvised desk in the goods shed groaned when he saw Paul&#x2019;s machine-gun. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2014;it jams.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It does.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;How often?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Too often for comfort.&#x2019;<br><br>The corporal sighed. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll get someone to have a look,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>&#x2018;Come back in an hour.&#x2019;<br><br>Two bench seats from the nearby railway station had been left outside the battalion command post entrance, offering a place to wait and watch the war go by. The two of them had only been sitting there a few minutes when a captured Red Army jeep pulled up. A Wehrmacht major and two NCOs leapt out, shoved their manacled Russian prisoner onto the other seat, and disappeared into the dugout. He looked like an ordinary rifleman, with dark dishevelled hair and vaguely Mongoloid features. He was wearing a bloodstained kaftan above badly frayed trousers and worse-worn boots. He sat there with his mouth slightly open, his eyes gazing blankly into space.<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t stupid. Catching Paul&#x2019;s look he returned it, and his eyes, once focused, seemed full of intelligence. &#x2018;Cigarette?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>That, at least, was one thing the Reich wasn&#x2019;t short of. Gerhart got up and gave him one, placing it between the Russian&#x2019;s lips and offering a lighted match.<br><br>&#x2018;Spasibo.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re welcome, Ivan.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, he fucking isn&#x2019;t,&#x2019; another voice exploded behind them. It was one of the NCOs who had brought him in. He knocked the cigarette from the Russian&#x2019;s mouth, throwing sparks all over his face, and swung round on Gerhart. &#x2018;What the fuck do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What I hope . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Shut the fuck up. And get out of my sight.&#x2019; He turned away, grabbed the Russian under one arm and hustled him through the curtained door of the dug-out.<br><br>&#x2018;Wonderful,&#x2019; was all Gerhart said. He looked at the still-swaying curtain, as if contemplating pursuit. <br>&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s try and find some hot water,&#x2019; Paul suggested.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere,&#x2019; Gerhart told him. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not going to let a shit like that order me around.&#x2019;<br><br>Paul shrugged and sat down again. There was no use arguing with Gerhart at times like this.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been sitting in silence for about a quarter of an hour when shouting started inside. This went on for several more minutes, and culminated in a gunshot. A few moments later, there was another.<br><br>Gerhart leapt to his feet.<br><br>&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go and find that hot water,&#x2019; Paul said quietly.<br><br>Gerhart spun round, anger in his eyes, but something in his friend&#x2019;s expression did the trick. He closed his eyes, breathed out heavily, and offered Paul a rueful smile. &#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;If we both take a bath, the war might stink a little less. Let&#x2019;s go and find one.&#x2019;<br><br>But they were out of luck. The only hot water in town came complete with a queue, and was already brown. A drink proved easier to come by, but the quality was equally dire, and after scorching their throats with a single glass neither felt thirsty for more. They went back to the workshop, but the mechanic still hadn&#x2019;t got round to checking the machine-gun. Rather than return to their seat outside the command post, they pulled a couple of armchairs out of the empty house next door, and settled down to wait. Paul thought about checking the location of the nearest basement, but found he couldn&#x2019;t be bothered. The sun was still shining, and it looked like the Red Air Force was having an afternoon off. If worse came to worst, they could simply throw themselves into the dugout across the yard.<br><br>Gerhart was devouring a cigarette, angrily sucking in smoke and flicking off ash while he wrestled with his inner demons. He was still pissed off about the Russian prisoner, Paul realised. Which might be admirable, but was unlikely to serve any useful purpose.<br><br>Paul had known him a long time. They&#x2019;d been best friends at their first school, but Gerhart&#x2019;s father had moved his family to Hamburg when both were nine, and they&#x2019;d only met up again two years ago, when both were drafted into the same flakhelfer unit at the Zoo Bunker Gun Tower. Gerhart had persuaded Paul that pre-enlistment in the Wehrmacht made sense, partly because he wanted out of the flakhelfer, partly to avoid SS recruitment. Paul had resisted for one reason&#x2014;the girl he had just fallen in love with was one of those directing the neighbouring tower&#x2019;s searchlights. But after Madeleine&#x2019;s mounting took a direct hit he could hardly wait to get away. He and Gerhart had started their compulsory labour service together, and then been called up as seventeen-year-olds when the age limit was lowered early in 1944. They were still gunners, but now they were soldiers of the 20th Panzergrenadier Division.<br><br>They had been with their Pak-43 88mm gun for almost a year, somehow surviving the collapse of Army Group Centre the previous summer and the winter battles in Poland. When they had left Berlin for their first Ostfront posting, Gerhart&#x2019;s mother had taken Paul aside and asked him to look after her son, but if anything Gerhart had looked after Paul. Gerhart&#x2019;s relentless negativity when it came to the war, the army and the F�hrer was sometimes irritating, but he never let it lessen his sense of duty toward his comrades. In fact, the one probably reinforced the other.<br><br>These days, Gerhart was the closest thing Paul had to family. His father John Russell had deserted him in 1941; his mother Ilse and stepfather Matthias Gehrts had died in a car crash the previous year. His stepsisters were alive as far as he knew, but Paul hadn&#x2019;t seen them since their evacuation two years ago, and the relationship had never been really close. He hadn&#x2019;t spoken to his mother&#x2019;s brother Thomas since their argument about his father almost three years ago.<br><br>&#x2018;Here he comes,&#x2019; Gerhart interjected. A mechanic was walking towards them, the machine-gun over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x2018;Is it fixed?&#x2019; Paul asked.<br><br>The mechanic shrugged. &#x2018;Seems to be. I just a filed off a few micrometres. Give it a proper test in the woods&#x2014;random gunfire this far behind the front makes people nervous.&#x2019;<br><br>Paul hoisted the gun over his own shoulder. &#x2018;Thanks.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No problem.&#x2019;<br><br>They walked back through Diedersdorf &#x2019;s empty streets. The young recruits on broom duty had vanished, but a Waffen-SS staff car was sitting in the otherwise empty square, and the gruppenf�hrer sitting in the back seat turned a surprisingly anxious pair of eyes in their direction.<br><br>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s seen the future, and it&#x2019;s not looking black,&#x2019; Gerhart joked.<br><br>The sweet-sucking youths had also moved on, and the road running north was empty. After about a kilometre they turned off into the trees, and followed the winding track to their position on the eastern edge of the wood. The unit&#x2019;s two cruciform-mounted 88mm anti-tank guns were dug in twenty metres apart, covering the distant Seelow-Diedersdorf road, which curved toward and across their line of vision. The first few Soviet tanks to bypass Seelow would certainly pay for their temerity, but those coming up behind them . . . well, their fate would depend on whether or not Paul&#x2019;s unit received another shipment of shells. They currently had nineteen, and two of those would be needed to destroy their own guns.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been here for over two months, and the dug-out accommodation was as spacious as any Paul had known in his short military career, three steps leading down to a short tunnel, with a tiny command post on one side and a small room full of bunks on the other. The ceilings weren&#x2019;t exactly thick, but they were well buttressed, and even a direct hit should prove survivable. The halftracks they needed to move the guns were parked a hundred metres away in the forest, and heavily camouflaged against a sighting from the air. They had fuel enough for sixty miles between them, which seemed unlikely to be enough. Then again, if no more shells were delivered, the guns would become effectively useless, and they could all ride back to Berlin in a single vehicle.<br><br>It had been a quiet day, Sergeant Utermann told them. The artillery barrage had been shorter than usual, and even less accurate&#x2014;nothing had fallen within a hundred metres of their small clearing. There&#x2019;d been no Soviet air raid, and three Messerschmitt 109s had appeared overhead, the first they&#x2019;d seen for a week. Maybe things were looking up at last.<br><br>&#x2018;And maybe Marlene Dietrich came home,&#x2019; Gerhart added sarcastically, once they were out of earshot. Utermann was a decent man, but a bit of an idiot.<br><br>Out in the clearing Hannes and Neumaier were kicking the unit&#x2019;sfootball to and fro. Hannes had found it in a Diedersdorf garden the previous week, and had hardly stopped playing with it since.<br><br>&#x2018;Shall we challenge them?&#x2019; Gerhart asked.<br><br>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; Paul agreed without much enthusiasm.<br><br>Greatcoats were found for posts, and two men from the other gun team cajoled into making it three-a-side. Paul had played a great deal as a child, and had loved watching his team Hertha. But the Hitlerjugend had turned the game into one more form of &#x2018;struggle&#x2019;, and he had always gone to the Plumpe stadium with his dad. A wave of anger accompanied that thought, and before he knew it he was almost breaking Neumaier&#x2019;s ankle with a reckless tackle.<br><br>&#x2018;Sorry, sorry,&#x2019; he said, offering the other boy his hand.<br><br>Neumaier gave him a look. &#x2018;What happens to you on a football pitch?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; Paul said again.<br><br>Neumaier shook his head and smiled.<br><br>The light was starting to fade, but they played on, engrossed in moving the football across the broken forest floor&#x2014;until the Soviet planes swept over the trees. They were Tupolevs, although right until the last moment Paul was somehow expecting Sergeant Utermann&#x2019;s Messerschmitt 109s. Like everyone else he dived for the ground, instinctively clawing at the earthen floor as fire and wood exploded above him. He felt a sharp pain in his left leg, but nothing more.<br><br>A single bomb, he thought. Turning his head he could see a wood splinter about ten centimetres long protruding from the back of his calf. Without really thinking, he reached back and yanked it out. His luck was in&#x2014;there was no sudden gush of arterial blood.<br><br>Two large trees were in flames on the western edge of the clearing, where Gerhart had gone to collect the ball. Paul counted the figures getting to their feet, and knew that one was missing. He scrambled to his own and rushed across to where his friend should be.<br><br>He found Gerhart lying on his back, a shard of wood driven deep into his throat, a bib of blood spread across his chest. Sinking to his knees, Paul thought he caught a flicker in the other&#x2019;s eyes, but they never moved again.<br>It seemed at first as if the DC-3 had landed in a forest clearing, but as the plane swung round John Russell caught sight of a long grey terminal building. The legend &#x2018;Moscow Airport (Vnukovo)&#x2019; was emblazoned across the facade in enormous Cyrillic letters, beneath an even larger hammer and sickle. He had expected the Khodynka airfield, which he had last seen in August 1939, decked out with swastikas for the welcoming of Ribbentrop and the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. He had never heard of Vnukovo, and hoped it was closer to the city centre than it looked. A wooden stairway on wheels was rolled out to meet the plane. It looked like something left over from the siege of Troy, and creaked alarmingly as the passengers stepped gingerly down to the tarmac. The sun was still above the tree line, and much warmer than Russell had anticipated. He joined the straggling procession towards the terminal building, a concrete edifice with all the architectural interest of a British pillbox. The constructivists would be turning in their graves, he thought, and they wouldn&#x2019;t be alone. As Russell had discovered in 1939, trips to Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union were guaranteed to disappoint those like himself who had welcomed the original revolution.<br><br>He joined the end of the queue, thinking that on this occasion a sense of ideological let-down was the least of his worries. First and foremost was the question of whether the Soviets had forgiven him for refusing their offer of hospitality at the end of 1941. After his escape from Germany&#x2014;an escape which German comrades under Soviet orders had died to make possible&#x2014;Stalin&#x2019;s representatives in Stockholm had done their best to persuade him that Moscow was an ideal place to sit out the war. They had even plucked his old contact Yevgeny Shchepkin out of the international ether in a vain attempt to talk him round.<br><br>He had explained to Shchepkin that he wasn&#x2019;t ungrateful, but that America had to be his first port of call. His mother and employer were there, and when it came to raising a hue and cry on behalf of Europe&#x2019;s Jews, the New York Times seemed a much better bet than Pravda.<br><br>What he hadn&#x2019;t told Shchepkin was how little he trusted the Soviets. He couldn&#x2019;t even work out why they were so keen to have him on board. Did they still see him and his rather unusual range of connections as a potential asset, to be kept in reserve for a relevant moment? Or did he know more about their networks and ways of operating than he was supposed to? If so, did they care? Would he receive the Order of Lenin or a one-way trip to the frozen north? It was impossible to tell. Dealing with Stalin&#x2019;s regime was like the English game of Battleships which he and his son Paul had used to play&#x2014;the only way...</p><h2>Cardcaptor Sakura - 100% Authentic Manga Volume 5</h2><p>Sakura has finally found the last Clow Card, but as she is about to find out, capturing all the cards is not enough to stop Evil from befalling the Earth.

These texts and illustrations show that the folk practices of the earliest Christians are quite similar to the day-to-day beliefs and rituals of spirituality that imbue indigenous primal religions and popular religion generally. Placing these previously unknown ancient texts in historical context and explaining their significance, Marvin Meyer and Richard Smith also reveal the place of healing, prayer, miracles, and magic in the Christian teaching practice.<br>Illustrated with line drawings and photographs from the original ancient documents and containing a plethora of rituals, curses, and spells, Ancient Christian Magic is the practical and liturgical companion to the narrative and theological texts of The Nag Hammadi Library.</p><p><p>"This book is a treasure-trove of material illustrating folk beliefs and practices of a people in Egypt spanning more than a thousand years."<b>--Birger A.

You already know David as the legendary warrior king of Israel, husband of Bathsheba, and father of Solomon; now meet David as he really was: the cocky Jewish kid, the plagiarized poet, and the Jewish father.

Thomas, former bass player for Elvis Costello and the Attractions, takes the reader on the road with an assortment of musicians, managers, and crew in this witty, acerbic account of a tour in the U.S.</p><p>We are delighted to have this classic book back in print.Imagine a rock 'n' roll star with shades of Marcel Proust's introspection, Hunter Thompson's sensibility and William Least Heat-Moon's ability to relate atmosphere. Such is Thomas's account of his experiences as the bass player for Elvis Costello and the Attractions, in which he details the absurdities of rock 'n' roll life. There are childish pranks: Cutting off a fellow drinker's awful tie and then drinking beer out of his wife's shoe as an apology, only to discover it's impossible with an open-toe shoe. There are absurdist moments: getting chased in Disney World after a minor indiscretion and watching the flashing light illuminate the mouse ears atop the police car's roof. Just below the surface, however, lurk hours of boredom breeding alienation: "Having no sense of place was beginning to unravel just a little sense of self." There are always too many miles to go with too much alcohol as company. Thomas's discovery of the trivial forces and common failings of life form the dark undercurrent of the book. Thomas is an honest storyteller of the first rank. He's not always likeable, as when his disaffection makes him belittle others, but he's always observant--particularly about himself. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Visual History of the Modern World</h2><p>A comprehensive and informative visual history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, from the Wright brothers first flight at the beginning of the last century to the devastating damage wreaked by Hurricane Katrina and the trial and execution of Saddam. <i>The Visual History of the Modern World</i> is a concise and authoritative overview of this modern age: times of war, peace, prosperity and progress.</p><p>Terry Burrows is one of Europe&#39;s biggest selling music authors--his &#34;Play Rock Guitar&#34; and &#34;Play Country Guitar &#34;have been published in 11 countries.

The focus, however, is on her struggle with addiction--alcoholism and "male dependency"--that grew as her acting career and personal life sputtered. A sudden star in her first major role, in Goodbye, Columbus in 1969, and the following year with the even more popular Love Story , she felt immediately that she was "in way over my head," mainly because of her fear of the camera ("I was scarcely trained at all as an actress"). Alcohol compounded problems and she continued to run after unavailable or hard-drinking or cold men. (Third husband Steve McQueen forbade MacGraw from working, yet convinced her to sign a prenuptual agreement that left her penniless after their divorce). In 1986, the actress spent a month at the Betty Ford clinic. Although she receives few film or TV job offers today, MacGraw is sober and "growing up at last." Photos not seen by PW. Literary Guild alternate; first serial to Cosmopolitan. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Twenty years ago, MacGraw was on top of the Hollywood heap, thanks to her starring roles in Goodbye, Columbus and Love Story . Ten years ago she was a star of a more dubious nature, thanks to the tabloids, following her tumultuous marriages to mogul Robert Evans and superstar Steve McQueen. Having not worked in film or TV in three years, McGraw now tells the whole sad story of her life. In what could be appropriately filed under "self-help," she writes extensively about coming to grips with her addictions to alcohol and men. This is certainly not a series of pretty pictures, but the clever use of the word "moving" in the title does work from time to time.

He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years.1<br>In Florida, hundred-year-old houses have solid<br>walls, so I guessed wrong when I heard my friend Birdy Tupplemeyer<br>make a bleating noise downstairs. I figured she&#x2019;d snuck a<br>man into her room, which was unfair of me, even though Birdy<br>admits to being free-minded when it comes to romance.<br><br>On windy October nights my imagination prefers love to spiders,<br>I guess. That is my only excuse.<br><br>I was in a hammock on the second floor in what had once been<br>a music room. Birdy, who lacks camping experience, had chosen a<br>downstairs room for her air mattress because it was closer to the<br>front door.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to hang off the balcony to pee,&#x201d; she had reasoned,<br>which made sense even before the wind freshened and the moon<br>rose. The house was abandoned; no electricity or water, and the<br>spiral staircase was in bad shape. I myself, after too much tea by<br>the fire, was debating whether to risk the balcony or those wobbly<br>steps when, through the floor, I heard a thump, another thump,<br>and then a mewling wail that reminded me of a cat that had found<br>companionship.<br><br>She&#x2019;s with that archaeologist, I thought, and buried my face in a<br>pillow, but not my ears&#x2014;a guilty device. My curiosity has always<br>had an indecent streak. I also had a reason. That afternoon we<br>had met Dr. Theo Ivanhoff, an assistant professor with shaggy<br>black hair: late twenties, khakis low on his skinny hips and wearing<br>a Greek fisherman&#x2019;s cap. He was on the property mapping<br>artifacts from a Civil War battle that had taken place before the<br>house was built. Theo had struck me as an aloof know-it-all and a<br>tad strange, but it had been a month since Birdy&#x2019;s last date so her<br>standards had loosened. Later, by the campfire, the two of us sitting<br>with tea and marshmallows, she had shared some bawdy remarks<br>including &#x201c;hung like a sash weight&#x201d; and &#x201c;Professor Boy<br>Toy,&#x201d; referring to a man only a few years younger than us.<br><br>Naturally, I felt supportive of my friend, not alarmed. Until I<br>heard: &#x201c;My god . . . what is that?&#x201d; which could have meant any<br>number of things.<br><br>Guilt battled my curiosity. I turned an ear to the floor just to be<br>on the safe side. Then shattering glass and a shattering scream<br>tumbled me out of the hammock and I was on my knees, feeling<br>around for a flashlight that had tumbled with me.<br><br>Birdy&#x2019;s voice again, more piercing: &#x201c;Bastard . . . get off.&#x201d;<br><br>Panic, not passion. I ran for the stairs. Thank heavens I was<br>barefoot, so I knew it was a flashlight I kicked across the room.<br>Bending to grab the thing, I clunked my head, then stubbed my<br>toe going out the door. In the hall, the flashlight&#x2019;s white beam<br>bounced among cobwebs and a dusty piano while Birdy screamed<br>my name.<br><br>&#x201c;Hannah . . .&#x201d;<br><br>I hollered back, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a gun!&#x201d; which was true, but the gun<br>was locked in my SUV, not in my hand. Then I put too much<br>weight on the banister as I catapulted down the stairs&#x2014;a brittle<br>pop; the banister fell. I spiraled down a few steps on my butt,<br>caught myself, then raced the banister to the bottom. The banister<br>won. I shoved it aside and was soon standing outside Birdy&#x2019;s door,<br>which was locked. That scared me even more.<br><br>I yelled, &#x201c;Birdy . . .?&#x201d; and pounded.<br><br>&#x201c;Get in here!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Open the door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s jammed! Oh . . shit, Hannah, hurry.&#x201d;<br><br>I wrenched the knob and used my shoulder. The door gave way<br>on the second try and I fell into the room, which was dark but for<br>moonlight reflecting off broken glass on the floor. I got to my feet<br>and, once again, had to hunt for the flashlight. My friend, dressed<br>in T-shirt and shorts, had her back to me and was dancing around<br>as if fighting cobwebs or in the midst of a seizure. &#x201c;Get it off, get<br>it off!&#x201d; she yelled, then winced when she turned, blinded by my<br>arrival.<br><br>I lowered the flashlight, relieved. I&#x2019;d feared an attacker, but she<br>was alone. I rushed across the room and put a hand on Birdy&#x2019;s arm<br>to stop her contortions. &#x201c;Hold still,&#x201d; I had to tell her twice while<br>I scanned her up and down. Finally I stepped back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see<br>anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was in my hair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How the hell should I know?&#x201d; Birdy added some F-bombs<br>and bowed her head for an inspection. I used my free hand, the<br>light close, to comb through her thick ginger hair, which was<br>darker at the roots, Birdy saying, &#x201c;I was almost asleep when something<br>landed on my face. Something with legs. It crawled up my<br>forehead, then stung me on the neck&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure there was more<br>than one. I tried to run, but the damn door wouldn&#x2019;t open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where on your neck?&#x201d;<br><br>I moved the light, but Birdy hollered, &#x201c;Finish with my hair<br>first!&#x201d; That told me the sting could wait.<br><br>&#x201c;Probably a palmetto bug. They don&#x2019;t sting, so you probably<br>imagined that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Imagined, my ass.&#x201d; Birdy pulled her T-shirt up, ribs showing,<br>a petite woman addicted to jogging who didn&#x2019;t get much sun because<br>of her freckles and red hair.<br><br>I checked her back and down her legs. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your flashlight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Goddamn bugs on my face, I must&#x2019;ve dropped it or something.<br>I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;d just found the switch when one bit the hell<br>out of me. Anybody would have lost it after that.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;That explains the broken window.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What broken window?&#x201d;<br><br>Birdy Tupplemeyer is a high-strung, energetic woman, but normally<br>steady in her behavior, as you would expect of a deputy sheriff<br>with two years&#x2019; experience. I had never seen her so upset. &#x201c;You<br>didn&#x2019;t hear the glass break? You must have thrown that light<br>pretty hard. I&#x2019;m glad you weren&#x2019;t waving your gun around when I<br>came through the door.&#x201d;<br><br>I bent to check the back of her neck, but first took a look<br>around the room, seeing glass on the pine flooring, the shattered<br>window, a moon-frosted oak tree outside, and my friend&#x2019;s air mattress,<br>a double-wide with cotton sheets, her overnight bag open in<br>the corner, clothes folded atop it.<br><br>&#x201c;My pistol&#x2019;s under the pillow,&#x201d; she countered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry<br>about getting shot. Worry about the damn bugs&#x2014;this freaking<br>room is infested.&#x201d; She shuddered and swore.<br><br>I pushed my flashlight into her hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a nurse. Check<br>inside your own pants.&#x201d;<br><br>Light in hand, Birdy pulled her shorts away from her hips, then<br>disappeared down her baggy T-shirt, the shirt glowing like a tent<br>until she reappeared. &#x201c;For once, I&#x2019;m glad to be flat-chested. Those<br>sons of bitches sting. Here . . . look for yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>She lifted her head, the light bright on a welt that was fiery red<br>on her freckled throat. My heart had stopped pounding, but now<br>I was concerned.<br><br>&#x201c;Give me that,&#x201d; I said, taking the light. &#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Burns like hell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it throbbing?&#x201d;<br><br>Birdy heard the change in my voice. &#x201c;Do you think it was a<br>spider? I hate spiders. Maybe I should go to the E-R. What time<br>is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop squirming,&#x201d; I said, but that&#x2019;s exactly why I was concerned.<br>I grew up camping, hiking, and fishing in the Florida<br>backcountry with my late uncle, Capt. Jake Smith, who became a<br>well-known guide after being shot and then retiring as a Tampa<br>detective. More than once, Jake had told me, &#x201c;People are the most<br>dangerous animals on earth. Everything else, avoid it and it will<br>avoid you.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake&#x2019;s long list included creatures that scare most newcomers<br>and keep them snug and safe inside their condos: snakes, sharks,<br>alligators, panthers&#x2014;and poison spiders, too. The only dangerous<br>spiders in Florida are black widows, brown widows, and, possibly,<br>the brown recluse, although I have yet to see a recluse for myself.<br>The widow spiders tend to be shy and seldom bite unless you mess<br>with them or happen to slap at one in your sleep. I&#x2019;ve seen many,<br>often living in colonies on porches of people who have no idea they<br>are there. Their spiky egg sacs are unmistakable. Which is why,<br>when camping, I prefer a screened hammock to a tent.<br><br>This was something I hadn&#x2019;t explained to Birdy. She had grown<br>up wealthy in a Boston suburb so was nervous from the start about<br>sleeping in a house that had a dark history and was fifteen miles<br>from the nearest town. Never mind that her Aunt Bunny Tupplemeyer,<br>a Palm Beach socialite, had hired me to spend a night or<br>two in the place and record the comings and goings of strangers.<br>The woman&#x2019;s reasons had to do with the million dollars she had<br>invested in river frontage that included the old house&#x2014;a house<br>she wanted torn down. Birdy was along to keep me company and,<br>as mentioned, was currently not dating, so had chosen adventure<br>over depression rather than spend her Friday night off alone.<br><br>She started to panic again. &#x201c;What if it was a poison spider?<br>Shit, I should have slept in my car.&#x201d; Being from Boston, she pronounced<br>it kaahr. She checked the time. &#x201c;It feels like midnight, but<br>it&#x2019;s not even nine-thirty. I know a woman doctor I can call&#x2014;she&#x2019;s<br>a gyno, but, hell, I&#x2019;ll just lie about where the damn thing bit me.&#x201d;<br><br>I touched my finger to a speck of blood on her neck. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a<br>sting, not a bite, but you&#x2019;ll be fine. A spider would have left two<br>little fang marks. I&#x2019;ve got some first-aid cream upstairs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fangs? Jesus Christ, my Beamer, I should&#x2019;ve crashed in the<br>backseat. Those bastards are probably in my bed right now, screwing<br>like rats and hatching babies. Smithie&#x201d;&#x2014;her nickname for<br>me&#x2014;&#x201c;we can&#x2019;t sleep here. My Aunt Bunny, that conniving bitch,<br>is to blame for this.&#x201d;<br><br>She was upset, so I discounted her words. &#x201c;It was a wasp, most<br>likely,&#x201d; I said, and, for the first time, shined the light at the ceiling<br>above the air mattress. Immediately, I pointed the light at the<br>floor, but too late.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh my god,&#x201d; Birdy whispered, &#x201c;what was that?&#x201d;<br><br>She yanked the light from me. Plaster overhead had broken,<br>showing rafters of hundred-year-old wood so dense with sap that<br>they glowed where it had beaded. But there were also glowing<br>silver eyes. Dozens of eyes attached to black armored bodies with<br>claws and curled tails. They were scorpions, some four inches<br>long. Stunned by the light, one fell with an air-mattress thump,<br>righted itself, and scrabbled toward us over clean cotton sheets<br>that were tasteful but not as practical as a sleeping bag.<br><br>Birdy screamed so didn&#x2019;t hear me say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, this kind isn&#x2019;t<br>dangerous,&#x201d; then nearly knocked me down running for the door.<br>2<br>My lineage includes many aunts and uncles, some<br>noteworthy, most not, but I have yet to refer to a family member<br>with the word Birdy used to blame her aunt for the presence of<br>scorpions in Florida.<br><br>The word struck me as unreasonable. On the other hand, it<br>also comforted me regarding my tolerance for a mother and at<br>least one aunt&#x2014;the third Hannah Smith in our family&#x2014;whose<br>behaviors have ranged from man-hungry to just plain crazy.<br><br>My mother, Loretta, and my late Aunt Hannah, being a mix of<br>both.<br><br>It is true, however, that Mrs. Bunny Tupplemeyer, a Palm<br>Beach widow, was the reason we were here.<br><br>Birdy, whose actual name is Liberty Grace, had invited me for<br>a weekend at her aunt&#x2019;s beach house, then a cocktail party at a<br>penthouse apartment that was downtown, close to shopping, at<br>the corner of Ocean Boulevard and Worth. It was a tenth-floor<br>saffron high-rise not far from the Kennedy compound, I was told.<br>The Opry mansion, with its gate and carved marble fountain, was<br>farther down the beach.<br><br>This was two weeks ago.<br><br>I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida but had never been<br>in downtown Palm Beach. Condos and shops possessed a gilded<br>indifference, the streets edged with royal palms from Prohibition<br>days. Residential areas were screened by towering hedges and a<br>muffled Rolls-Royce hush that warned of money and double<br>standards.<br><br>&#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; Birdy kept telling me in the car. &#x201c;Just be yourself. If the<br>Great Dame starts interrogating you&#x2014;and she will&#x2014;just smile<br>and compliment her jewelry. Or bring up astrology. She loves<br>guessing people&#x2019;s signs. While she&#x2019;s boring you with that, signal<br>the staff for another martini. Dame Bunny likes them icy cold.&#x201d;<br><br>Dame Bunny, that&#x2019;s how my friend referred to her wealthy, socialite<br>aunt.<br><br>There was no need for me to relax because I wasn&#x2019;t nervous. I&#x2019;m<br>a light tackle fishing guide who deals with wealthy clients day after<br>day in a small skiff around Sanibel and Captiva Islands, although I<br>live across the bay on the island of Gumbo Limbo. I&#x2019;ve learned that<br>the rich are no different than the rest of us when it comes to tangling<br>lines, or whoops of delight when a big fish jumps, or when<br>their bladder demands a bucket and a moment of privacy.<br><br>Birdy was the nervous one, not me.<br><br>Odd, I thought. She had summered in Palm Beach as a girl<br>and during college. Her mother, Candice, had been a Palm Beach<br>debutante prior to graduating from Wellesley, then joined a commune<br>near Aspen, which, I was told, had only solidified the family&#x2019;s<br>Palm Beach&#x2013;Boston ties.<br><br>&#x201c;To people with money, politics are more of a fashion statement,&#x201d;<br>Birdy had explained.<br><br>But when I&#x2019;d spent some time with her Aunt Bunny, I understood<br>why my friend was nervous. It was at the cocktail party.<br>I had escaped to the balcony. An Italian banker, after backing<br>me in a corner, had been a little too touchy-feely for comfort. My<br>hostess noticed and followed me outside, a martini in one hand, a<br>cigarette in the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Tired of Victor, the sex-starved poodle?&#x201d; she asked, sliding the<br>door closed. Then looked me up and down, noting the simple gray<br>shift I wore belted at the waist, my leather flats and a lavender<br>scarf I had bought at Pulitzer&#x2019;s just down the street. &#x201c;With your<br>legs,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised he&#x2019;s sniffing around. But you<br>could stand to lose a few pounds, darling.&#x201d;<br><br>I ignored the insult out of respect for my drunken elders. &#x201c;He<br>said his name is Vittorio,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I asked him to spell it because<br>of his accent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Made him spell it,&#x201d; the woman repeated, fascinated I would<br>bother.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good way to remember names. He was polite enough,<br>but I wanted to see what the ocean looks like from out here. Very<br>nice place you have, Mrs. Tupplemeyer.&#x201d; On the Gulf Stream,<br>miles away, tankers the size of buildings drifted, the sky blacker, it<br>seemed, than a dark night on Sanibel.<br><br>The woman stood beside me at the marble rail and flicked<br>ashes. &#x201c;Smart girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His wife was watching. She&#x2019;s one drink away from making a<br>scene. You&#x2019;ve got enough size, I don&#x2019;t think even Rita would try<br>the slapping, hair-pulling thing. But who knows? She drinks absinthe,<br>the real stuff, and sniffs cocaine to stay thin.&#x201d; A pause. She<br>blew smoke into the night and pivoted. &#x201c;My niece says your family<br>has quite a history in Florida. That you know people I wouldn&#x2019;t<br>know&#x2014;locals.&#x201d;<br><br>Hicks and rednecks is what she meant.<br><br>She continued, &#x201c;She also told me you shot a man a year or so<br>ago. Damn near killed him. Is that true?&#x201d;<br><br>I pretended not to hear and asked about a bracelet on her wrist<br>that glittered with scarlet stones.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t change the subject. Any woman who can pull the trigger,<br>I find that damn impressive. But I&#x2019;m unclear about exactly<br>what it is you do. Are you a fishing guide or do you run an investigation<br>agency?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Both, ma&#x2019;am, but mostly fishing.

The city<p>was a carnival of wondrous things to do for as little as pennies</p><p>if one could spare a few.</p><p>The bells of Windsor&#x2019;s Parish Church and St. George&#x2019;s Chapel rang</p><p>throughout the day. Ships were dressed in flags, and royal salutes boomed</p><p>from cannons to celebrate the Duke of Edinburgh&#x2019;s forty-fourth birthday.</p><p>The Crystal Palace offered a dazzling spectrum of special programs:</p><p>organ recitals, military band concerts, a &#x201c;monster display of fireworks,&#x201d;</p><p>a grand fairy ballet, ventriloquists, and &#x201c;world famous minstrel performances.&#x201d;</p><p>Madame Tussaud&#x2019;s featured a special wax model of Frederick</p><p>II lying in state and, of course, the ever-popular Chamber of Horrors.</p><p>Other delicious horrors awaited those who could afford theater tickets</p><p>and were in the mood for a morality play or just a good old-fashioned</p><p>fright. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was playing to sold-out houses. The famous</p><p>American actor Richard Mansfield was brilliant as Jekyll and Hyde</p><p>__</p><p>C H A P T E R O N E</p><p>M R . N O B O D Y</p><p>at Henry Irving&#x2019;s Lyceum, and the Opera Comique had its version, too,</p><p>although poorly reviewed and in the midst of a scandal because the theater</p><p>had adapted Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s novel without permission.</p><p>On this bank holiday there were horse and cattle shows; special</p><p>&#x201c;cheap rates&#x201d; on trains; and the bazaars in Covent Garden overflowing</p><p>with Sheffield plates, gold, jewelry, used military uniforms. If one wanted</p><p>to pretend to be a soldier on this relaxed but rowdy day, he could do so</p><p>with little expense and no questions asked. Or one could impersonate a</p><p>copper by renting an authentic Metropolitan Police uniform from Angel&#x2019;s</p><p>Theatrical Costumes in Camden Town, scarcely a two-mile stroll from</p><p>where the handsome Walter Richard Sickert lived.</p><p>Twenty-eight-year-old Sickert had given up his obscure acting career</p><p>for the higher calling of art. He was a painter, an etcher, a student of</p><p>James McNeill Whistler, and a disciple of Edgar Degas. Young Sickert</p><p>was himself a work of art: slender, with a strong upper body from swimming,</p><p>a perfectly angled nose and jaw, thick wavy blond hair, and blue</p><p>eyes that were as inscrutable and penetrating as his secret thoughts and</p><p>piercing mind. One might almost have called him pretty, except for his</p><p>mouth, which could narrow into a hard, cruel line. His precise height is</p><p>unknown, but a friend of his described him as a little above average. Photographs</p><p>and several items of clothing donated to the Tate Gallery</p><p>Archive in the 1980s suggest he was probably five foot eight or nine.</p><p>Sickert was fluent in German, English, French, and Italian. He knew</p><p>Latin well enough to teach it to friends, and he was well acquainted with</p><p>Danish and Greek and possibly knew a smattering of Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p>He was said to read the classics in their original languages, but</p><p>he didn&#x2019;t always finish a book once he started it. It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to</p><p>find dozens of novels strewn about, opened to the last page that had</p><p>snagged his interest. Mostly, Sickert was addicted to newspapers,</p><p>tabloids, and journals.</p><p>Until his death in 1942, his studios and studies looked like a recycling</p><p>center for just about every bit of newsprint to roll off the European</p><p>P A T R I C I A C O R N W E L L</p><p>[ 2 ]</p><p>presses. One might ask how any hard-working person could find time to</p><p>go through four, five, six, ten newspapers a day, but Sickert had a</p><p>method. He didn&#x2019;t bother with what didn&#x2019;t interest him, whether it was</p><p>politics, economics, world affairs, wars, or people. Nothing mattered to</p><p>Sickert unless it somehow affected Sickert.</p><p>He usually preferred to read about the latest entertainment to come</p><p>to town, to scrutinize art critiques, to turn quickly to any story about</p><p>crime, and to search for his own name if there was any reason it might</p><p>be in print on a given day. He was fond of letters to the editor, especially</p><p>ones he wrote and signed with a pseudonym. Sickert relished knowing</p><p>what other people were doing, especially in the privacy of their own notalways-</p><p>so-tidy Victorian lives. &#x201c;Write, write, write!&#x201d; he would beg his</p><p>friends. &#x201c;Tell me in detail all sorts of things, things that have amused you</p><p>and how and when and where, and all sorts of gossip about every one.&#x201d;</p><p>Sickert despised the upper class, but he was a star stalker. He somehow</p><p>managed to hobnob with the major celebrities of the day: Henry Irving</p><p>and Ellen Terry, Aubrey Beardsley, Henry James, Max Beerbohm,</p><p>Oscar Wilde, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Rodin, Andr� Gide, �douard Dujardin,</p><p>Proust, Members of Parliament. But he did not necessarily know</p><p>many of them, and no one famous or otherwise ever really knew him.</p><p>Not even his first wife, Ellen, who would turn forty in less than two</p><p>weeks. Sickert may not have given much thought to his wife&#x2019;s birthday</p><p>on this bank holiday, but it was extremely unlikely he had forgotten it.</p><p>He was much admired for his amazing memory. Throughout his life</p><p>he would amuse dinner guests by performing long passages of musicals</p><p>and plays, dressed for the parts, his recitations flawless. Sickert would</p><p>not have forgotten that Ellen&#x2019;s birthday was August 18th and a very easy</p><p>occasion to ruin. Maybe he would &#x201c;forget.&#x201d; Maybe he would vanish into</p><p>one of his secret rented hovels that he called studios. Maybe he would</p><p>take Ellen to a romantic caf� in Soho and leave her alone at the table</p><p>while he dashed off to a music hall and then stayed out the rest of the</p><p>night. Ellen loved Sickert all her sad life, despite his cold heart, his patho-</p><p>P O R T R A I T O F A K I L L E R</p><p>[ 3 ]</p><p>logical lying, his self-centeredness, and his habit of disappearing for</p><p>days even weeks without warning or explanation.</p><p>Walter Sickert was an actor by nature more than by virtue of employment.</p><p>He lived on the center stage of his secret, fantasy-driven life</p><p>and was just as comfortable moving about unnoticed in the deep shadows</p><p>of isolated streets as he was in the midst of throbbing crowds. He</p><p>had a great range of voice and was a master of greasepaint and wardrobe.</p><p>So gifted at disguise was he that as a boy he often went about unrecognized</p><p>by his neighbors and family.</p><p>Throughout his long and celebrated life, he was notorious for constantly</p><p>changing his appearance with a variety of beards and mustaches,</p><p>for his bizarre dress that in some cases constituted costumes, for his hairstyles </p><p>including shaving his head. He was, wrote French artist and</p><p>friend Jacques-Emile Blanche, a &#x201c;Proteus.&#x201d; Sickert&#x2019;s &#x201c;genius for camouflage</p><p>in dress, in the fashion of wearing his hair, and in his manner of</p><p>speaking rival Fregoli&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Blanche recalled. In a portrait Wilson Steer</p><p>painted of Sickert in 1890, Sickert sports a phony-looking mustache that</p><p>resembles a squirrel&#x2019;s tail pasted above his mouth.</p><p>He also had a penchant for changing his name. His acting career,</p><p>paintings, etchings, drawings, and prolific letters to colleagues, friends,</p><p>and newspapers reveal many personas: Mr. Nemo (Latin for &#x201c;Mr. Nobody&#x201d;),</p><p>An Enthusiast, A Whistlerite, Your Art Critic, An Outsider, Walter</p><p>Sickert, Sickert, Walter R. Sickert, Richard Sickert, W. R. Sickert,</p><p>W.S., R.S., S., Dick, W. St., Rd. Sickert LL.D., R.St. A.R.A., and RDSt</p><p>A.R.A.</p><p>Sickert did not write his memoirs, keep a diary or calendar, or date</p><p>most of his letters or works of art, so it is difficult to know where he was</p><p>or what he was doing on or during any given day, week, month, or even</p><p>year. I could find no record of his whereabouts or activities on August 6,</p><p>1888, but there is no reason to suspect he was not in London. Based on</p><p>notes he scribbled on music-hall sketches, he was in London just two days</p><p>earlier, on August 4th.</p><p>P A T R I C I A C O R N W E L L</p><p>[ 4 ]</p><p>Whistler would be getting married in London five days later, on August</p><p>11th. Although Sickert hadn&#x2019;t been invited to the small, intimate</p><p>wedding, he wasn&#x2019;t the sort to miss it even if he had to spy on it.</p><p>The great painter James McNeill Whistler had fallen deeply in love</p><p>with the &#x201c;remarkably pretty&#x201d; Beatrice Godwin, who was to occupy the</p><p>most prominent position in his life and entirely change the course of it.</p><p>Likewise, Whistler occupied one of the most prominent positions in Sickert&#x2019;s</p><p>life and had entirely changed the course of it. &#x201c;Nice boy, Walter,&#x201d;</p><p>Whistler used to say in the early 1880s when he was still fond of the aspiring</p><p>and extraordinarily gifted young man. By the time of Whistler&#x2019;s</p><p>engagement their friendship had cooled, but Sickert could not have been</p><p>prepared for what must have seemed a shockingly unexpected and complete</p><p>abandonment by the Master he idolized, envied, and hated.</p><p>Whistler and his new bride planned to honeymoon and travel the rest of</p><p>the year in France, where they hoped to reside permanently.</p><p>The anticipated connubial bliss of the flamboyant artistic genius and</p><p>egocentric James McNeill Whistler must have been disconcerting to his</p><p>former errand boy&#x2013;apprentice. One of Sickert&#x2019;s many roles was the irresistible</p><p>womanizer, but offstage he was nothing of the sort. Sickert was</p><p>dependent on women and loathed them. They were intellectually inferior</p><p>and useless except as caretakers or objects to manipulate, especially for</p><p>art or money. Women were a dangerous reminder of an infuriating and</p><p>humiliating secret that Sickert carried not only to the grave but beyond</p><p>it, because cremated bodies reveal no tales of the flesh, even if they are</p><p>exhumed. Sickert was born with a deformity of his penis requiring surgeries</p><p>when he was a toddler that would have left him disfigured if not</p><p>mutilated. He probably was incapable of an erection. He may not have</p><p>had enough of a penis left for penetration, and it is quite possible he had</p><p>to squat like a woman to urinate.</p><p>&#x201c;My theory of the crimes is that the criminal has been badly disfigured,&#x201d;</p><p>says an October 4, 1888, letter filed with the Whitechapel Murders</p><p>papers at the Corporation of London Records Office, &#x201c; possibly</p><p>P O R T R A I T O F A K I L L E R</p><p>[ 5 ]</p><p>had his privy member destroyed &amp; he is now revenging himself on the</p><p>sex by these atrocities.&#x201d; The letter is written in purple pencil and enigmatically</p><p>signed &#x201c;Scotus,&#x201d; which could be the Latin for Scotsman.</p><p>&#x201c;Scotch&#x201d; can mean a shallow incision or to cut. Scotus could also be a</p><p>strange and erudite reference to Johannes Scotus Eriugena, a ninthcentury</p><p>theologian and teacher of grammar and dialectics.</p><p>For Walter Sickert to imagine Whistler in love and enjoying a sexual</p><p>relationship with a woman might well have been the catalyst that made</p><p>Sickert one of the most dangerous and confounding killers of all time.</p><p>He began to act out what he had scripted most of his life, not only in</p><p>thought but in boyhood sketches that depicted women being abducted,</p><p>tied up, and stabbed.</p><p>The psychology of a violent, remorseless murderer is not defined by</p><p>connecting dots. There are no facile explanations or infallible sequences</p><p>of cause and effect. But the compass of human nature can point a certain</p><p>way, and Sickert&#x2019;s feelings could only have been inflamed by</p><p>Whistler&#x2019;s marrying the widow of architect and archaeologist Edward</p><p>Godwin, the man who had lived with actress Ellen Terry and fathered</p><p>her children.</p><p>The sensuously beautiful Ellen Terry was one of the most famous actresses</p><p>of the Victorian era, and Sickert was fixated on her. As a teenager,</p><p>he had stalked her and her acting partner, Henry Irving. Now Whistler</p><p>had links to not one but both objects of Sickert&#x2019;s obsessions, and these</p><p>three stars in Sickert&#x2019;s universe formed a constellation that did not include</p><p>him. The stars cared nothing about him. He was truly Mr. Nemo.</p><p>But in the late summer of 1888 he gave himself a new stage name that</p><p>during his life would never be linked to him, a name that soon enough</p><p>would be far better known than those of Whistler, Irving, and Terry.</p><p>The actualization of Jack the Ripper&#x2019;s violent fantasies began on the</p><p>carefree bank holiday of August 6, 1888, when he slipped out of the</p><p>wings to make his debut in a series of ghastly performances that were destined</p><p>to become the most celebrated so-called murder mystery in history.</p><p>P A T R I C I A C O R N W E L L</p><p>[ 6 ]</p><p>It is widely and incorrectly believed that his violent spree ended as</p><p>abruptly as it began, that he struck out of nowhere and then vanished</p><p>from the scene.</p><p>Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and his bloody sexual</p><p>crimes have become anemic and impotent. They are puzzles, mystery</p><p>weekends, games, and &#x201c;Ripper Walks&#x201d; that end with pints in the Ten</p><p>Bells pub.

Authors John Szarkowski and Richard Benson have collected 100 photos taken between the years 1859 and 1956, all concerning some aspect of boats, boat building, and maritime life: the exuberance of a boat christening in 1900 and the eerie foreignness of arctic whalers in 1882, for example; shipwrecks and shipbuilders abound, and many of the photographs--those from the 19th century, especially--focus on the skin and bones of the trade, from the rotting shells of abandoned boats to the boilers and propellers of ships in the making.<p> The camera's subject might have been the sea, but the book is about so much more. Szarkowski, the former director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, has selected each of these photos as much for what they say about humanity's relationship to the sea as for the artistry of the pictures themselves. Richard Benson's commentary, meanwhile, speaks of technology, the futility of war, and the effects of mass production, as well as a wealth of information about maritime life. More than just a coffee-table book, <i>A Maritime Album</i> offers plenty of food for thought about the sea and the place it occupies in our lives and dreams.</p><i>A Maritime Album</i> is a book for coffee tables and collectors, a moving testimonial to the exaltation and apprehension of human interaction with the sea.

He has also won the World Fantasy Award, the British Fantasy Award, and many others, and in 2008 was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.Chapter One <br><br>BETWEEN WAKEFULNESS AND sleeping, we have most of us had the illusion of hearing voices, scraps of conversation, phrases spoken in unfamiliar tones. Sometimes we attempt to attune our minds so that we can hear more, but we are rarely successful. Between wakefulness and sleeping, I began, every night, to hear voices . . . <br><br><i>Had I hung, for an eternity in limbo? Was I alive&#x2013;dead? Was there a memory of a world which lay in the far past or the distant future? Of another world which seemed closer? And the names? Was I John Daker or Erekos&#x2018;? Was I either of these? Many other names, Shaleen, Artos, Brian, Umpata, Roland, Ilanth, Ulysses, Alric, fled away down the ghostly rivers of my memory. I hung in darkness, bodiless. A man spoke. Where was he? I tried to look but had no eyes to see. <br></i><br>*** <br><br>&#x201c;Erekos� the Champion, where are you?&#x201d; <br><br>Another voice, then: &#x201c;Father . . . it is only a legend . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No, Iolinda. I feel he is listening. Erekos� . . .&#x201d; <br><br>I tried to answer, but had no voice. Swirling half-dreams of a house in a great city of miracles, a swollen, grimy city of miracles, crammed with dull-coloured machines, many of which bore human passengers. Of buildings, beautiful beneath their coatings of dust and of other, brighter buildings not so beautiful, with austere lines and many glass windows. Of a troop of riders galloping over an undulating countryside, flamboyant in armour of lacquered gold, coloured pennants draped around their blood-encrusted lances. Their faces were heavy with weariness. Of more faces, many faces, some of which I half recognized, others which were unfamiliar, people clad in strange clothes. A picture of a white haired, middle-aged man who had a tall, spiked crown upon his head. His mouth moved, he was speaking . . . <br><br>&#x201c;Erekos�, it is I, King Rigenos, Defender of Humanity. You are needed again, Erekos�. The Hounds of Evil rule a third of the world and humankind is weary of the war against them. Come to us, Erekos� and lead us to victory. From the Plains of Melting Ice to the Mountains of Sorrow they have set up their corrupt standard and I fear they will advance yet further into our territories.&#x201d; <br><br>The woman&#x2019;s voice: &#x201c;Father, this is only an empty tomb. Not even the mummy of Erekos� remains&#x2013;it became drifting dust long ago. Let us leave and return to Necranal to marshal the living peers.&#x201d; <br><br>I felt like a fainting man who strives to fight against dizzy oblivion but, however much he tries, cannot take control of his own brain. Again I tried to answer, but could not. <br><br>It was as if I wavered backwards through time, while every atom of me wanted to go forwards. I had the sensation of vast size as if I were made of stone with eyelids of granite, measuring miles across&#x2013;eyelids which I could not open. And then I was tiny&#x2013;the most minute grain in the universe, and yet I felt I belonged to the whole far more than the stone giant.<br>Memories came and went. The whole panorama of the twentieth century, its beauties and its bitternesses, its satisfactions, its strifing, rushed into my mind like air into a vacuum. But it was only momentary, for the next second my entire being was flung elsewhere&#x2013;to a world which was Earth, but not the Earth of John Daker, not quite the world of dead Erekos�, either. <br><br>There were three great continents, two close together, divided from the other by a vast sea containing many islands, large and small. <br><br>I saw an ocean of ice which I knew to be slowly shrinking&#x2013;the Plains of Melting Ice. I saw the third continent which bore lush flora, mighty forests, blue lakes and was bound along its northern coasts by a towering chain of mountains&#x2013;the Mountains of Sorrow. This I knew to be the domain of the Eldren, whom King Rigenos had called the Hounds of Evil. <br><br>Now, on the other two continents, I saw the wheatlands of the West on the continent of Zavara, with their tall cities of multicoloured rock, the rich cities of the wheatlands&#x2013;Stalaco, Calodemia, Mooros and Ninadoon. <br><br>There were the great seaports&#x2013;Shilaal, Wedmah, Sinana, Tarkar, and Noonos of towers cobbled with precious stones. <br>Then I saw the fortress cities of the Continent of Necralala, with the capital city Necranal chief among them, built on, into and about a mighty mountain, peaked by the spreading palace of its warrior kings. <br>Now a little more came clear as, in the background of my awareness, I heard a voice calling <i>Erekos&#x2018;, Erekos&#x2018;, Erekos&#x2018; . . . <br></i><br>The warrior kings of Necranal, kings for two thousand years of Humanity united, at war, and united again. The warrior kings of whom King Rigenos was the last living and aging now, with only a daughter, Iolinda, to carry on his line. Old and weary with hate&#x2013;but still hating. Hating the unhuman folk whom he called the Hounds of Evil, mankind&#x2019;s age-old enemies, reckless and wild, linked, it was said, by a thin line of blood to the human race&#x2013;an outcome of a union between an ancient queen and the Evil One, Azmobaana. <br><br>Hated by King Rigenos as soulless immortals, slaves of Azmobaana&#x2019;s machinations. <br><br>And, hating, he called upon John Daker, whom he called Erekos�, to aid him with his war against them. <br>&#x201c;Erekos�, I beg thee answer me. Are you ready to come?&#x201d; His voice was loud and echoing and when, after a struggle, I could reply, my own voice seemed to echo also. <br><br>&#x201c;I am ready,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;but appear to be chained.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Chained?</i>&#x201d; There was consternation in his voice. &#x201c;Are you, then, a prisoner of Azmobaana&#x2019;s frightful minions? Are you trapped upon the Ghost Worlds?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I do not think so. It is space and time which chain me. I am separated from you by a gulf.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Already we pray that you may come to us.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then continue,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>I was falling away again. I thought I remembered laughter, sadness, pride. Then, suddenly, more faces, I felt as if I witnessed the passing of everyone I had known, down the ages, and then one face superimposed itself over the others&#x2013;the head and shoulders of an amazingly beautiful woman, with blonde hair piled beneath a diadem of precious stones which seemed to light the sweetness of her oval face. &#x201c;Iolinda,&#x201d; I said. I saw her more solidly now. She was clinging to the arm of the tall, gaunt man who wore a crown&#x2013;King Rigenos. <br><br>They stood before an empty platform of quartz and gold, and resting on a cushion of dust was a straight sword which they dared not touch. Neither did they dare step too close to it for it gave off a radiation which might slay them. <br><br>It was a tomb in which they stood. The Tomb of Erekos�&#x2013;my tomb. I moved towards the platform, hanging over it. Ages before, my body had been placed there. I stared at the sword which held no dangers for me but was unable, in my captivity, to pick it up. It was my spirit only which inhabited the dark place&#x2013;but the whole of my spirit now, not the fragment which had inhabited the tomb for thousands of years. The fragment which had heard King Rigenos and had enabled John Daker to hear it, to come to it and be united with it. <br><br>&#x201c;Erekos�!&#x201d; called the king, straining his eyes through the gloom as if he had seen me. &#x201c;Erekos�&#x2013;we pray.&#x201d; <br><br>Then I experienced the dreadful pain which I suppose a woman to go through when bearing a child. A pain that seemed eternal and yet was intrinsically its own vanquisher. I was screaming, writhing in the air above them. Great spasms of agony&#x2013;but an agony complete with purpose&#x2013;the purpose of creation. <br>At last I was standing, materially, before them. <br><br>&#x201c;I have come,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I am here, King Rigenos. I have left nothing worthwhile behind me&#x2013;but do not let me regret that leaving.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You will not regret it, Champion.&#x201d; He was pale, exhilarated, smiling. I looked at Iolinda who dropped her eyes modestly and then, as if against her will, raised them again to regard me. I turned to the dais on my right. <br><br>&#x201c;My sword,&#x201d; I said reaching for it. <br><br>I heard King Rigenos sigh with satisfaction. <br><br>&#x201c;They are doomed, now, the dogs,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>They had a sheath for the sword. It had been made days before. King Rigenos left to get it, leaving me alone with Iolinda. I did not question my being there and neither, it seemed, did she. We regarded one another silently until the king returned with the scabbard. <br><br>&#x201c;This will protect us against your sword&#x2019;s poison,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>I took it, slid the sword into it. The scabbard was opaque, like glass. The metal was unfamiliar to me, as John Daker, light, sharp, dull as lead. Yet the feel of it awaked dim remembrance which I did not bother to arouse. Why was I the only one who could wear the sword without being affected by its radiation? <br>Was it because I was constitutionally different in some way to the rest of these people? Was it that the ancient Erekos� and the unborn John Daker (or was that vice versa?) had metabolisms which had become adapted in some way against the power which flowed from the sword? <br><br>I had become, in that transition from my own age to this, unconcerned. It was as if I was aware that my fate had been taken out of my own hands to a large extent. I had become a tool. If only I had known for what I should be used, then I might have fought against the pull and remained harmless, ineffectual John Daker. But perhaps I could not have fought. <br><br>At any rate, I was prepared from the moment I materialized in the Tomb of Erekos� to do whatever Fate demanded of me. Later, things were to change. <br><br>I walked out of the tomb into a calm day, warm with a light breeze blowing. We stood on a small hill. <br>Below us a caravan awaited&#x2013;there were richly caparisoned horses and a guard of men dressed in that same golden armour I had seen in my dreams, but these warriors were fresher-looking. <br><br>The armour was fluted, embellished with raised designs, ornate and beautiful but, according to my sparse reading on the subject of armour, coupled with Erekos�&#x2019;s stirring memory, totally unsuitable for war. The fluting and embossing acted as a trap to catch the point of a spear or sword, whereas armour should be made to turn a point. This armour, for all its beauty, acted more as an extra danger than a protection. <br><br>The guards were mounted on heavy war horses but the beasts that knelt awaiting us resembled a kind of camel out of which all the camel&#x2019;s lumpen ugliness had been bred. These beasts were beautiful. On their high backs were cabins of ebony, ivory and mother-o&#x2019;-pearl, curtained in scintillating silks. <br><br>We walked down the hill and, as we walked, I noticed that I was dressed in the pyjamas I had worn when first I went to bed. I was surprised, although they were not wholly incongruous, since the king&#x2019;s garments were flowing and loose, but they seemed wrong. I felt that I should have left these, also, behind me&#x2013;on another body. But perhaps there is no body left behind.</p><h2>Truckers</h2><p>Reluctant to believe that there&#39;s a world outside the department store in which they live, Torrit, Dorcas, and the other nomes look to Masklin, a newly arrived &#34;outsider,&#34; to lead them to a safe haven when the store goes out of business.</p><p>The first title in the hilarious fantasy trilogy about the nomes.Terry Pratchett is one of the most popular authors writing today.

Sales are now over 600,000 copies. In each brief chapter the author contemplates the seemingly ordinary experiences that add joy to life, whether it's the first sip of beer, the snowstorm inside a paperweight, reading an Agatha Christie novel, or the smell of apples.<br><br>At once uniquely French and yet universal, told with a lively, almost childlike curiosity, this charming book reminds us to enjoy and appreciate the small things that make life worthwhile. <br><br></p><p>This French bestseller revels in life's small pleasures. Whether it be a croissant in the street, the Tour de France, a potluck, shelling peas, a glass of port, the smell of apples, the mobile library, a garden in August, getting your espadrilles wet, or an autumn sweater, these 34 short essays delight in the simple. In colorful, sensory language that's perfect for reading out loud, author Philippe Delerm paints a world of possibility and profound joy. <p> From the title essay: </p><blockquote>It's the <i>almost</i> that counts, and the use of the conditional. The suggestion seems absurd at first. It's only the beginning of March and there's been nothing but rain, wind and showers all week. And now this. Since this morning, the sun's been shining with a sort of dull intensity, a calm persistence. Lunch is ready, and the table's been laid. But everything seems different somehow, even inside. The window's slightly ajar, there's an audible hum from outside and the air feels fresh.</blockquote> Though it could easily be read in one sitting, this book is the kind to savor piece by piece like the delicacies of day-to-day life the author serves up as small, precious gifts. <i>--Kathryn True</i><br><b>Philippe Delerm</b> was born in 1950.

So I asked a lady walking up the avenue, "Have you seen Art?" <br> "MoMA?" asked the lady. <br> "Uh . . . no, he's just a friend." <br> "Just down Fifty-Third Street here. In a beautiful new building. You can't miss it." </i> <br> When this address turns out to be the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, confusion and hilarity ensue. As the narrator continues looking for Art inside MoMA, he is introduced to well-known pieces of art such as Van Gogh's <i>The Starry Night,</i> Matisse's <i>The Red Studio,</i> as well as works by Picasso, Klee, Lichtenstein and others. <br> In a dynamic collaboration that features comical text and playful illustrations alongside full-color reproductions of the artwork, Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith give readers the perfect companion for a visit to MoMA, and an introduction to some of the world's best works of modern art.</p><p>Multiple award-winning author Jon Scieszka grew up in Flint, Michigan, the second oldest and the nicest of six boys. Jon went to school at Culver Military Academy in Indiana where he was a Lieutenant; Albion College in Michigan where he studied to be a doctor; and Columbia University in New York, where he received an M.F.A. in fiction. He taught elementary school in New York for ten years in a variety of positions. He is the author of many books for children including the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book&nbsp;The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), the Caldecott Honor book&nbsp;The True Story of the Three Little Pigs&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), and&nbsp;Math Curse&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith). &nbsp;In addition to his work as an author, Jon also runs a web-based literacy program called &#x201c;Guys Read&#x201d; that is designed to encourage boys, particularly reluctant readers, to get involved with books. In 2008, Jon was named the country&#x2019;s first National Ambassador for Young People&#x2019;s Literature, a joint effort of the Library of Congress and the Children&#x2019;s Book Council. During his two-year role as Ambassador, he acted as a spokesperson for children&#x2019;s literature, speaking to groups of parents, teachers, and children to encourage the importance of reading. You can visit Jon online at www.jsworldwide.com.Grade 3 Up&#x2013;The collection at the recently re-opened Museum of Modern Art in New York City forms the framework for this cheeky foray into contemporary art appreciation. While trying to find his friend in Manhattan, a boy asks a passerby, "Have you seen Art?" and sets off a chain of events that propels him through the museum on an unexpected journey of artistic discovery. Once inside, every variation of his "where is Art?" request compels helpful museum-goers to respond in a more esoteric fashion as each visitor briefly introduces the works of his or her favorite contemporary artist to the narrator. After a thorough, eye-opening tour, the boy finds himself back where he started. But now when he is asked, "Did you find art?" he resoundingly replies, "YES!" And, on the final page, he does; Art is waiting for him outside the museum doors. The unusually long and narrow shape of the book and the stylized characters echo the modern-art theme while the muted background tones are an effective foil for the well-reproduced if sometimes diminutive artwork. The hip, first-person narrative is deliberately repetitive but becomes somewhat tiresome as the book's length appears to be determined more by providing a broad overview of the museum's holdings than by a compelling plot. Pair this with Anthony Browne's <i>The Shape Game</i> (Farrar, 2003) before a museum visit or as part of an art appreciation unit. For anyone planning a trip to MoMA with a youngster, this is a provocative read.&#x2013;<i>Carol Ann Wilson, formerly at Westfield Memorial Library, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The days were warm and the air hard to breathe without a kerchief, and the nights cold and damp, the wet burlap we nailed over the windows stiff with grit that blew in clouds out of the west amid sounds like a train grinding across the prairie. The moon was orange, or sometimes brown, as big as a planet, the way it is at harvest time, and the sun never more than a smudge, like a lightbulb flickering in the socket or a lucifer match burning inside its own smoke. In better times, our family would have been sitting together on the porch, in wicker chairs or on the glider, with glasses of lemonade and bowls of peach ice cream.<br> <br>My father was looking for work on a pipeline in East Texas. Maybe he would come back one day. Or maybe not. Back then, people had a way of walking down a tar road and crossing through a pool of heat and disappearing forever. I ascribed the signs of my mother&#x2019;s mental deterioration to my father&#x2019;s absence and his difficulties with alcohol. She wore out the rug in her bedroom walking in circles, squeezing her nails into the heels of her hands, talking to herself, her eyes watery with levels of fear and confusion that nobody could dispel. Ordinary people no longer visited our home.<br> <br>As a lawman, Grandfather had gone up against the likes of Bill Dalton and John Wesley Hardin, and in 1916, with a group of rogue Texas Rangers, he had helped ambush a train loaded with Pancho Villa&#x2019;s soldiers. The point is, he wasn&#x2019;t given to studying on the complexities of mental illness. That didn&#x2019;t mean he was an ill-natured or entirely uncharitable man, just one who seemed to have a hole in his thinking. He had not been a good father to his children. Through either selfishness or ineptitude, he often left them to their own devices, even when they foundered on the wayside. I had never understood this obvious character defect in him. I sometimes wondered if the blood he had shed had made him incapable of love.<br> <br>He hid behind flippancy and cynicism. He rated all politicians &#x201c;somewhere between mediocre and piss-poor.&#x201d; His first wife had &#x201c;a face that could make a freight train turn on a dirt road.&#x201d; WPA stood for We Piddle Around. If he hadn&#x2019;t been a Christian, he would have fired the hired help (we no longer had any) and &#x201c;replaced them with sloths.&#x201d; The local banker had a big nose because the air was free. Who was my grandfather in actuality? I didn&#x2019;t have a clue.<br> <br>It was right at sunset when I looked through the back screen and saw a black automobile, coated with dust and shaped like a shoe box, detour off the road and drive into the woods behind our house. A man wearing a fedora and a white shirt without a tie got out and urinated in front of the headlights. I thought I could hear laughter inside the car. While he relieved himself, he removed his fedora and combed his hair. It was wavy and thick and brown and shiny as polished walnut. His trousers were notched tightly into his ribs, and his cheeks looked like they had been rubbed with soot. These were not uncommon characteristics in the men who drifted here and yon through the American West during the first administration of President Roosevelt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some people must have wandered off the highway onto our road,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The driver is taking a leak in front of his headlights. His passengers seem to be enjoying themselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grandfather was sitting at the kitchen table, an encyclopedia open in front of him, his reading glasses on his nose. &#x201c;He deliberately stood in front of his headlights to make water, so others could watch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t speak with authority about his thought process, since I&#x2019;m not inside the man&#x2019;s head,&#x201d; I replied. I picked up the German binoculars my uncle had brought back from the trenches and focused them on the car. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a woman in the front seat. A second man and another woman are in back. They&#x2019;re passing a bottle around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are they wets?&#x201d;<br> <br>I removed the binoculars from my eyes. &#x201c;If wets drive four-door cars.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My first wife had a sense of humor like yours. The only time I ever saw her laugh was when she realized I&#x2019;d developed shingles.&#x201d;<br> <br>I focused the binoculars back on the driver. I thought I had seen his face before. I heard Grandfather get up heavily from his chair. He was over six and a half feet tall, and his ankles were swollen from hypertension and caused him to sway back and forth, as though he were on board a ship. Sometimes he used a walking cane, sometimes not. One day he seemed to teeter on the edge of eternity; the next day he was ready to resume his old habits down at the saloon. He had gin roses in his cheeks and skin like a baby&#x2019;s and narrow eyes that were the palest blue I had ever seen. Sometimes his eyes did not go with his face or his voice; the intense light in them could make other men glance away. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take a walk, Satchel Ass,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t call me that name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a butt on you like a washtub.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bullet hole in the rear window of the car,&#x201d; I said, looking through the binoculars again. &#x201c;My butt doesn&#x2019;t resemble a washtub. I don&#x2019;t like you talking to me like that, Grandfather.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wide butts and big hips run in the Holland family. That&#x2019;s just something to keep in mind as you get older. It&#x2019;s a family trait, not an insult. Would you marry a woman who looks like a sack of Irish potatoes?&#x201d;<br> <br>He pulled open a kitchen drawer and removed a holstered revolver that was wrapped with the belt, the loops stuffed with brass shells. The revolver was the dull color of an old Buffalo nickel. It had been converted long ago for cartridges, but the black-powder tamping rod was still in place, fitted with a working hinge under the barrel. The top of the holster had been worn smooth and yellow along the edges of the leather. Six tiny notches had been filed along the base of the revolver&#x2019;s grips. Grandfather hung the belt from his shoulder and put on his Stetson. The brim was wilted, the crown sweat-stained a dark gray above the brim. He went out the screen door into the waning twilight.<br> <br>The windmill was ginning furiously, the stanchions trembling with energy, a thread of water coming from the spout, the tank crusted with dirt and dead insects and animal hair along the rims. &#x201c;The moon looks like it was dipped in a teacup. I cain&#x2019;t believe how we used to take the rain for granted,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I think this land must be cursed.&#x201d;<br> <br>The air smelled of ash and dust and creosote and horse and cow manure that feathered in your hand if you picked it up. Dry lightning leaped through the heavens and died, like somebody removing an oil lamp from the window of a darkened house. I thought I felt thunder course through the ground under my shoes. &#x201c;Feel that?&#x201d; I said, hoping to change Grandfather&#x2019;s mood and my own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get your hopes up. That&#x2019;s the Katy blowing down the line,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I made fun of your butt, Satch. I won&#x2019;t do it no more. Walk behind me till we know who&#x2019;s in that car.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we approached the tree line, the driver of the car walked out of the headlights and stood silhouetted against the glare, then got back in his car and started the engine and clanked the transmission into gear. The trees were so dry they made a sound like paper rustling when the wind blew through the canopy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold up there,&#x201d; Grandfather said to the man.<br> <br>I thought the driver would simply motor away. But he didn&#x2019;t. He stuck his elbow out the window and stared straight into our faces, his expression curious rather than alarmed. &#x201c;You talking to us?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on my property,&#x201d; Grandfather said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought this was public woods,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a posted sign that says otherwise, I didn&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman next to him was pretty and had strawberry-blond hair and a beret tilted over one eye. She looked like a happy country girl, the kind who works in a dime store or in a caf� where the truckers come in to make innocent talk. She leaned forward and grinned up into Grandfather&#x2019;s face. She silently mouthed the words &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you know you have mud on your license tag?&#x201d; Grandfather asked the driver.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get right on that,&#x201d; the driver said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You also have what appears to be a bullet hole in your back window.&#x201d;<br> <br>The driver removed a marble from the ashtray in the dashboard and held it against the light. &#x201c;I found this on the backseat. It was probably a kid with a slingshot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw a kid up on the train trestle with one. You a lawman?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a rancher. The name is Hackberry Holland. You didn&#x2019;t give me yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Smith,&#x201d; the driver said.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll tell me your destination, Mr. Smith, maybe I can he&#x2019;p you find your way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lubbock. Or anyplace there&#x2019;s work. I work on automotives, mostly. Is that an antique firearm?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A forty-four Army Colt. Most of the time I use it for a paperweight. You know automobiles, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, you could say that. I see automobiles as the future of the country. Henry Ford and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Turn left at the paved road and stay due west,&#x201d; Grandfather said. &#x201c;If you see the Pacific Ocean, that means you passed Lubbock.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man in the backseat rolled down the glass. He was short and not over 120 pounds and wore a suit and tie and a short-brim hat cocked on his brow the way a dandy might. He had a long face, like a horse&#x2019;s hanging out of a stall. He also had the kind of lopsided grin you see on stupid people who think they&#x2019;re smarter than you. His breath was as rank as a barrel of spoiled fruit. &#x201c;My name is Raymond. This here is my girlfriend, Miss Mary,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re pleased to make y&#x2019;all&#x2019;s acquaintance.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman sitting next to him had a cleft chin and a broad forehead and a small mean-spirited Irish mouth; her face was sunken in the middle, like soft wax. She was smoking a cigarette, gazing into the smoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a busted spar in my cattle guard,&#x201d; Grandfather said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t pop a tire going out. I&#x2019;d appreciate you not throwing that whiskey bottle in my trees, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tidy is as tidy does,&#x201d; Raymond said.<br> <br>Grandfather rested one hand on the bottom of the window. He let his eyes roam over Raymond&#x2019;s face before he spoke. &#x201c;The man who kills you will rip out your throat before you ever know what hit you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking about myself, just somebody you might meet up the road, the kind of fellow who turns out to be the worst misjudgment you ever made.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We apologize, sir,&#x201d; said the woman in front, leaning across the driver so Grandfather could see her expression more clearly. Her smile made me think of somebody opening a music box. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t mean to bother y&#x2019;all. You have a mighty nice spot here. Thank you for being so gracious and kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No harm done,&#x201d; Grandfather said.<br> <br>I wanted her to say something to me, but her gaze stayed fixed on Grandfather.<br> <br>The driver slowly accelerated the car, a nimbus of brown dust rising from the wax job, our visitors&#x2019; silhouettes framed against the headlights. There was a long bright-silver scratch on the left fender. After they were gone, I could feel Grandfather&#x2019;s eyes on me, like he was about to give me a quiz to see how dumb I was at that particular moment. &#x201c;What are you studying on, Satch?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;The car and the way they treat it don&#x2019;t fit. You think they&#x2019;re bank robbers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you haven&#x2019;t heard, there&#x2019;s no money in the bank to rob. Or in the general store. Or in the bubblegum machine at the filling station. Where in the name of suffering Jesus have you been, boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I picked up a rock and threw it in a high arc and heard it clatter through the trees. &#x201c;Why do you have to make light of everything I say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you take the world too seriously. Let&#x2019;s go see what your mother is doing. I bought some peach ice cream this afternoon. That&#x2019;s always her favorite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you talking on the phone to the doctor,&#x201d; I said. Suddenly you could hear the crickets in the dark, the whistle of the Katy beyond the horizon. The dust clogged my nostrils and throat. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fixing to send her for electroshock treatments, aren&#x2019;t you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The doctor raised that possibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They use electroshock when they don&#x2019;t know what else to do. I think the doctor is an ignorant man. In addition, he&#x2019;s stupid and thinks meanness and intelligence are the same thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He says electroshock is the most modern treatment for what ails her. It&#x2019;s done in a hospital. She&#x2019;ll have the best of care there. It could be worse. Sometimes they push a steel probe into the brain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On the subject of care, I wonder why nobody gave her any when she was a little girl and had to fend for herself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re developing a hard edge, Weldon. It&#x2019;s not in your nature. It&#x2019;ll eat up your youth and rob you of the wisdom that should come with manhood.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hate you, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me something,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you ever think about forgiveness?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For you, Grandfather? No, I don&#x2019;t. If you&#x2019;ve ever sought forgiveness for anything, I&#x2019;ve yet to see the instance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about forgiveness for all of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you going to call the sheriff about the people in the car?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not our business. If they come back, that&#x2019;s another matter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The woman in the front seat caught your eye,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;All women do. That&#x2019;s the way things work. That&#x2019;s why preachers are always railing about sex. It&#x2019;s here for the long haul.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could not take my grandfather&#x2019;s proselytizing. &#x201c;A stranger with a sweet smile is the light of the world, but your own daughter doesn&#x2019;t mean diddly squat on a rock.&#x201d;<br> <br>I instantly regretted the harshness of my words. He walked ahead of me, the holstered revolver swinging back and forth under his arm, the windmill blades rattling in the wind. When we entered the house, my mother was eating from the carton of ice cream Grandfather had bought, and cleaning the spoon with her hair.<br> <br>WHEN MY MOTHER&#x2019;S spells first began, she told us she had dreams she could not remember, but she was convinced they contained information of vast importance. Behind her eyes, you could see her drawing a rake through her thoughts, as though on the verge of discovering the source of all her unhappiness. Her early hours seemed to be neither good nor bad; she said morning was a yellow room that sometimes had a sunny window in it. But after three P.M., when the sun began to move irrevocably toward the horizon, a chemical transformation seemed to take place inside her head. Her eyes would become haunted, darting at the row of poplars on the side lawn, as though a specter were beckoning to her from the shade.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Emma Jean?&#x201d; my father said the first time it happened.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t hear them?&#x201d; she replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The whisperers. They&#x2019;re over there, by the garden wall.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at me. I&#x2019;m your husband, the man who loves you. There is no one else in the yard except you and me and Weldon.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother went silent, seeming to believe now more than ever that we were her enemies, and she could not understand the poisonous vapor that awaited her every afternoon when the sun became a red wafer inside the dust clouds rising in the west.<br> <br>After Grandfather and I returned to the house, I washed my mother&#x2019;s hair in the upstairs bathroom and dried it with the electric fan, lifting it off her neck and eyes.

But what about rye whiskey, Madeira wine, and fine imported Cognac? Or peach brandy, applejack, and lager beer? At various times in the past, these drinks were as likely to be found at the Southern bar as barrel-aged bourbon and raw corn likker. The image of genteel planters in white suits sipping mint juleps on the veranda is a myth that never was--the true picture is far more complex and fascinating.&nbsp;<i>Southern Spirits</i>&nbsp;is the first book to tell the full story of liquor, beer, and wine in the American South. This story is deeply intertwined with the region, from the period when British colonists found themselves stranded in a new world without their native beer, to the 21st century, when classic spirits and cocktails of the pre-Prohibition South have come back into vogue. Along the way, the book challenges the stereotypes of Southern drinking culture, including the ubiquity of bourbon and the geographic definition of the South itself, and reveals how that culture has shaped the South and America as a whole.</p><p>ROBERT F.

On a day like any other, Ping sets off from the boat he calls home with his comically large family in search of "pleasant things to eat." On this particular day, he is accidentally left behind when the boat leaves. Undaunted, the little duck heads out onto the Yangtze in search of his family, only to find new friends and adventures--and a bit of peril--around every bend. <p> The exceptional illustrations bring the lush Yangtze to life, from Ping's family to the trained fishing birds he finds himself among to the faithfully rendered boats and fishermen. Certainly intended to be read aloud, <i>The Story About Ping</i> deserves a place on every young reader's (or listener's) shelf. (Picture book)</p><b>Marjorie Flack</b> first got the idea for her classic story from her first book, written by her friend Helen Lomen. The Peking ducks in <i>Angus and the Ducks</i>&nbsp;so intrigued her that she began researching them. <i>The Story About Ping</i>&nbsp;was the result. She went on to write and illustrate many more children's stories, including <i>Boats on the River</i>, illustrated by Jay Hyde Barnum, which was named a Caldecott Honor Book. Ms. Flack died in 1958.<br><br><b>Kurt Wiese</b> illustrated almost three hundred books for children. Books he both wrote and illustrated include <i>You Can Write Chinese</i>&nbsp;and <i>Fish in the Air</i>. Both stories were named Caldecott Honor Books, and reflect his experiences as a traveler in China where he lived for six years. Mr. Wiese died in 1974.</p><h2>Nicholas Again</h2><p>.A collection of stories which continues the adventures and misadventures of little Nicolas and his friends at school and at play.</p><p>Ren� Goscinny (1926 &#x2013; 1977) is the world-famous writer and creator, along with Albert Uderzo, of the adventures of Asterix the Gaul. Born in Paris, Goscinny lived in Buenos Aires and New York before returning to France in the 1950s where he met Semp�. They collaborated on picture strips and then stories about Nicholas. An internationally successful children&#x2019;s author, he also won awards for his animated cartoons. <p>Jean-Jacques Semp� (b. 1932) is one of the most successful and best-loved cartoonists and illustrators in the world. He has published numerous collections of his work in his native France and thirty other countries since 1962, and still regularly contributes to magazines such as the New Yorker and Paris Match. He lives in Paris. </p><p>Anthea Bell was awarded the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the Helen and Kurt Wolff Prize (USA) in 2002 for her translation of W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz. Her many works of translation from French and German (for which she has received several other awards) include the Nicholas books and, with Derek Hockridge, the entire Asterix the Gaul saga.</p>Gr. 3-5. Irrepressible French schoolboy Nicholas returns in this follow-up to 2006 Batchelder Honor book <i>Nicholas </i>(2005)--the first two of five existing books to be affectionately translated by Bell, none of which have been previously available in the U.S. In brief, stand-alone vignettes punctuated with line drawings by <i>New Yorker </i>illustrator Sempe, Nicholas continues to tussle with his gang of elementary-school pals, exasperate Old Spud and other school officials, and obliviously push his parents' buttons. The sophisticated-looking cloth format may be difficult for some young readers to get past, as will a few dated references (Asterix creator Goscinny originated this character in the 1950s). There are also elements that seem out of place in an illustrated chapter book, including humor drawn from adult-world dynamics and one insult translated as "feeble-ass." Readers who enthusiastically tackle American novels about mischievous elementary school kids may not be quite up to this worldlier French version, but they'll certainly enjoy hearing the silliest tales read aloud, and chapter-a-day sharing may help gather an audience among slightly older children, too. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Have you lost the art of reading for pleasure? Are there books you know you should read but haven&#39;t because they seem too daunting? In The Well-Educated Mind, Susan Wise Bauer provides a welcome and encouraging antidote to the distractions of our age, electronic and otherwise. In her previous book, The Well-Trained Mind, the author provided a road map of classical education for parents wishing to home-school their children, and that book is now the premier resource for home-schoolers. In this new book, Bauer takes the same elements and techniques and adapts them to the use of adult readers who want both enjoyment and self-improvement from the time they spend reading. The Well-Educated Mind offers brief, entertaining histories of five literary genres-fiction, autobiography, history, drama, and poetry-accompanied by detailed instructions on how to read each type. The annotated lists at the end of each chapter-ranging from Cervantes to A. S. Byatt, Herodotus to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich-preview recommended reading and encourage readers to make vital connections between ancient traditions and contemporary writing. The Well-Educated Mind reassures those readers who worry that they read too slowly or with below-average comprehension. If you can understand a daily newspaper, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t read and enjoy Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets or Jane Eyre. But no one should attempt to read the &#34;Great Books&#34; without a guide and a plan. Susan Wise Bauer will show you how to allocate time to your reading on a regular basis; how to master a difficult argument; how to make personal and literary judgments about what you read; how to appreciate the resonant links among texts within a genre-what does Anna Karenina owe to Madame Bovary?-and also between genres. Followed carefully, the advice in The Well-Educated Mind will restore and expand the pleasure of the written word.</p><p></p><h2>Body Shop Book</h2><p>An authoritative guide by one of the world&#39;s premier cosmetic companies presents a quick and easy guide to personal well-being, discussing such topics as the benefits of massage, aromatherapy, the sun and aging, skin and hair care, cosmetics, and more. 25,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Cold Comfort Farm: Tie-In</h2><p>When a well-educated young socialite in 1930s England is left orphaned and unable to support herself at age twenty-two, she moves in with her eccentric relatives on their farm</p><p>Stella Gibbons was born in London in 1902. She went to North London Collegiate School and studied journalism at University College, London. She then worked for ten years on various papers, including the Evening Standard. Her first publication was a book of poems, The Mountain Beast (1930), and her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932), won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize. Amongst her other novels are Miss Linsey and Pa (1936), Nightingale Wood (1938), Westwood (1946), Conference at Cold Comfort Farm (1949) and Beside the Pearly Water (1954). Stella Gibbons died in 1989.Narrator Anna Massey has her work cut out for her as she takes on the eccentric Starr family of Cold Comfort Farm. Massey conveys humor and even a touch of suspense. The sights, sounds, even the smells of the farm are evoked amid the minutia of Gibbons&#39;s details. The very sounds of the words have as much effect as the tale they tell. Gibbons&#39;s use of melodrama popular in the early 1900&#39;s, to tell a romantic tale while simultaneously satirizing the genre, makes Massey&#39;s job more challenging. She manages quite well. The resurrection of the farm from brooding ineffectuality to normal human activity is worth listening to over and over. D.P.D.

Morris (Randolph, VT) - &#34;Bees Besieged&#34; portrays the current state of honeybees and their keepers in America. Hobbyist Mares comes out to his hive one day and finds all his bees dead. His curiosity about what had befallen his bees leads to a spiraling journey to learn about what he describes as &#34;the manifold problems facing bees generally, and their keepers.&#34; Mares is very much the observer, adopting an impartial journalistic stance as his base of knowledge grows. Occasionally, he will venture an opinion or take a stance, but mostly he is content to find the experts and let them be the storytellers. He begins in Vermont. Each interview points to a new referral, a new perspective, and another piece to the puzzle. The story becomes bigger, more complex, and more important. After a while the author is not trying to understand why his bees died, but what will happen to life on the planet if endangered pollinators become extinct. His circle widens as he travels to the District of Columbia, Texas, Louisiana, and beyond to learn about the current state of bees. It&#39;s not a pretty picture. Bees are besieged from all directions-environmental degradation, insidious mites (such as the ones that caused the author&#39;s bees to die), fluctuating honey prices, and aggressive, invasive species such as the much-ballyhooed African killer bees. It&#39;s a much larger story than just about bees and honey, as these insects play a vital role in the pollination of many agricultural crops. Threats to the bee population, therefore, are threats to the worldwide food supply. &#34;Bees Besieged&#34; is a must read for beekeepers, but its also for environmentalists, naturalists, and social observers.</p><p>Bill Mares received a cum laude degree in history from Harvard and an M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Litwack constructs a searing, unforgettable account of life in the Jim Crow South. Drawing on a vast array of contemporary documents and first-person narratives from both blacks and whites, he examines how black men and women learned to live with the severe restrictions imposed on their lives during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br>Emancipation had been a time of unparalleled hope, laden with possibility, but the great changes black Southerners envisioned proved to be illusory. Litwack relates how black schools and colleges struggled to fulfill the expectations placed on them in a climate that was separate but hardly equal; how hardworking tenant farmers were cheated of their earnings, turned off their land, or refused acreage they could afford to purchase; how successful and ambitious blacks often became targets of white vio-lence and harassment. Faced with evidence of black independence and assertiveness, the white South responded with a policy of oppression and subjugation that systematically "disrecognized" black people. <br><br>By maintaining rigid patterns of racial segregation, manipulating the judicial system, and enforcing ignorance among blacks, the white South sustained unprecedented levels of violence, brutality, and intimidation. Yet despite being faced with these overwhelming odds, many blacks found ways to resist and circumvent the system. Litwack shows how blacks not only coped with crushing poverty and misery, but also found refuge in their own institutions and managed to preserve their humanity and dignity through religion, work, music, and (frequently subversive) humor. <br><br>Presented before, but never in such a thorough, wrenching manner, the history of this deeply scarred period is essential to any understanding of the state of race relations in America today.</p><p>The name of the era, "Jim Crow," was somehow derived from an old minstrel song, but there was nothing frivolous about the laws and traditions used to keep blacks from participating in society in the post-Reconstruction South. Leon Litwack, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a noted authority on black history, has written a searing account of the age of Jim Crow in <i>Trouble In Mind</i>. The book is arranged in thematic chapters that show how blacks were restricted at every turn. Blacks were kept in perpetual debt, denied proper schooling, and were subjected to daily assaults on their dignity. Most disturbing was the institution of lynchings, the thousands of hangings and burnings that terrorized blacks in the South. Litwack documents how lynchings were carefully planned and attracted large crowds who viewed them as cathartic entertainment. <i>Trouble In Mind</i> deals with a long and sad chapter in American History, but Professor Litwack has written a laudable book which deserves to be read. <i>Trouble In Mind</i> is considered a sequel to Litwack's <i>Been In the Storm So Long</i>, a critically acclaimed account of Reconstruction which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History."This is the most complete and moving account we have had of what the victims of the Jim Crow South suffered and somehow endured."<br>--C.

A specialist in the culture and literature of Athens during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., she teaches at Columbia University and New York University&#x2019;s Gallatin School. <br><b>From Elizabeth Watson Scharffenberger&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Republic</i></b> <br><br>The conversation in <i>Republic</i> begins simply enough. Socrates, who has plainly been on familiar terms with Polemarchus&#x2019; family for a long time, forthrightly asks Cephalus about old age. His response, that aging is not as difficult as it is often reported to be, prompts Socrates to wonder out loud whether Cephalus&#x2019; easygoing attitude is in part facilitated by his wealth. The old man&#x2019;s response is affirmative. The wealthy, he asserts, face death without fear; their resources enable them to satisfy their debts to gods and men and also to avoid lying and cheating, and thus they can die with the confidence that they will not be punished in the afterlife. These remarks are what precipitate the discussion of just behavior and moral conduct, which Socrates introduces as he asks his elderly friend whether &#x201c;justice&#x201d; (<i>dikaiosyn�</i>) simply consists of paying debts and telling the truth. Cephalus politely bows out of the conversation, leaving his son Polemarchus to argue that justice&#x2014;meaning &#x201c;right behavior&#x201d; in general&#x2014;does indeed consist of paying debts and giving &#x201c;what is due,&#x201d; as poets such as Simonides claim. Socrates, however, quickly leads Polemarchus to realize that there are serious logical problems with this traditional conception of justice, in which &#x201c;what is due&#x201d; is defined in terms of &#x201c;help&#x201d; to &#x201c;friends&#x201d; and &#x201c;harm&#x201d; to &#x201c;enemies,&#x201d; and the young man is left perplexed.<br>At this point, Thrasymachus leaps into the discussion, asserting that justice is simply &#x201c;the advantage of the stronger,&#x201d; by which he clearly means that &#x201c;justice&#x201d; is relative&#x2014;that is, &#x201c;right behavior&#x201d; is whatever those in power determine it to be. With a series of questions that recall those he just posed to Polemarchus, Socrates uncovers logical problems in Thrasymachus&#x2019; definition as well. Thrasymachus, however, does not give up. Exploding in frustration at Socrates&#x2019; naive assumptions about the responsibilities that the powerful bear to those who are under their control, he reformulates his ideas with a bold new emphasis evocative of Antiphon&#x2019;s thinking in &#x201c;On Truth.&#x201d; &#x201c;Justice&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, the circumspect avoidance of doing &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; to others and obedience to social rules&#x2014;is doing what is advantageous to another, who is stronger and more powerful than oneself. &#x201c;Injustice,&#x201d; on the other hand, is doing what is to one&#x2019;s own advantage by taking what one wants regardless of social rules and by aggrandizing oneself at the expense of others. It is what leads to &#x201c;happiness,&#x201d; provided that one is not penalized for one&#x2019;s exploitations. Tyrants who kill and confiscate and rape at will, according to Thrasymachus, are the happiest men of all.<br>Although Socrates is able to poke holes through the logic of this new formulation with questions that hark back once again to those he has already posed, Thrasymachus&#x2019; sulky concessions leave him unconvinced that he has made an effective case for the connection between justice, which through all has not been adequately defined, and &#x201c;happiness.&#x201d; Nor are Glaucon and Adeimantus convinced, and it is their persistence at the beginning of book 2 that launches the more systematic and extensive inquiry into the nature of justice and its relationship to happiness that occupies the rest of <i>Republic</i>. In particular, the brothers ask Socrates to explain how justice is <i>in itself</i> the source of happiness, regardless of whether it is recognized and rewarded, and how the just man can be happy, regardless of his material circumstances.<br>The challenges of defining justice and understanding its effects on long-term happiness, fulfillment, and well-being&#x2014;all of which are conveyed by the Greek word <i>eudaimonia</i>&#x2014;lead to the discussion of the ideal city-state, which is posited as a large-scale vehicle for apprehending the operations of justice in the individual. Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus spend a good deal of time and energy discussing how the ideal state will be organized, and how its classes of warriors and leaders will be selected, educated, and provided for; they are especially concerned in books 2 and 3 with the training and acculturation of guardian children, whose exposure to poetry (<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> in particular) is to be severely curtailed lest they learn harmful values and patterns of behavior.<br>Yet the three never lose sight of the goals of their examination. By the end of book 4, they arrive at a working (and, in several regards, striking) definition of justice as the condition, or state of being, in which each person in the community&#x2014;and each element of the individual human soul (<i>psyche</i>)&#x2014;minds his/her/its own business and does his/her/its own &#x201c;work.&#x201d; Since it has been determined that there is in the human soul, as in human society, a natural ruling element, justice is thus equated with the unencumbered rule of these elements: the &#x201c;gold&#x201d; class of guardians in the ideal state, which holds sway over the silver and bronze/iron classes, and, in the individual, the rational part of the soul that ought to be master of both &#x201c;spirit&#x201d; and appetites.<br><br></p><h2>Sociology, 17Th Edition</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

But it was hard going since huge flakes of snow fell thick and fast on top of the six inches already on the ground.<br><br>Josh had corralled the rest of his manger scene animals, but Melly, an eight-foot-tall female camel, loved to wander. Josh had told Lydia to stay put in the barn and Melly would find her way back, but while he was feeding his sheep, Lydia had gone out, anyway. Though she was annoyed with the big beast right now, Melly's waywardness made Lydia love the camel even more. She sympathized with the animal's stubborn nature.<br><br>"Melly! Melly!" she called. The bitter wind bit deep into her throat and seemed to puff back out in each cloud of breath she exhaled.

"Melly, you bad girl, where are you?"<br><br>Lydia was grateful for her deep bonnet brim and warm cape, but her long skirt and apron were a problem as she lifted booted feet to plod toward the tall woven wire fence that kept the animals in Josh's large enclosure.

So handsome with his green-blue eyes and gold-as-wheat hair, he was tall for an Amish man. <em>Ya,</em> she looked up to him in more ways than one. If only she could say that about her come-calling friend, Gid Reich, whom her <em>daad</em> kept inviting to dinner, even though she saw him each day at work. She didn't want to let her <em>daad</em> and <em>mamm</em> down, but she'd tried to tell them Gid wasn't for her. Still, on paper, as they say, he seemed the perfect match.<br><br>Lydia stopped for a moment to get her bearings. Surely, she wasn't walking in circles. Her parents would scold her for going out in a storm, because they were very protective. She understood that. They had lost their only other child in a tragic accident. Just beyond the fence was Creek Pond, where her five-year-old brother, Sammy, had drowned years ago. Her mother, who blamed herself for the boy's death, didn't want her daughter anywhere near the pond, summer or winter.<br><br>Lydia traced her way along the fence. If worse came to worst, it would guide her back to the big Yoder barn where Josh housed and tended his menagerie. But&#x2014;oh, no&#x2014;the back gate was open several feet! It had a latch, so could that crazy camel have escaped through the gap and be wandering back toward the pond? Would Melly's weight crack right through the ice? Sammy's screams clawed at Lydia's memory again, but it was just the shrill shriek of the wind. A tear froze on her cheek, but she kept going.<br><br>She reached out and dragged the narrow gate closed and latched it. She'd have to head straight back to tell Josh now. Who could have left the gate ajar, let alone opened it? Surely, not the wind. All Josh's other workers, some hired, some volunteers like her, knew to keep the animals in this big field and they'd gone home hours ago&#x2014;Saturday night, time for courting.<br><br>Josh had kidded once about how Melly "liked to swing for the fences." The camel loved to scratch her sides on the woven wire. Lydia could picture the big baby, along with her cohorts, Gaspar and Balty, poking their furry-lipped muzzles through the fence in good weather while they watched buggies and vehicles go by on the road. Talk about stopping traffic! The sight of camels in the heart of Ohio Amish country had caused more than one fender bender.<br><br>As Lydia trudged back toward the barn, praying she'd find her favorite camel, she stumbled over something low, sprawled under the white shroud of snow. She let out a little scream. Thank the Lord, it was too small to be Melly. She backed away. When the person&#x2014;it was a person&#x2014;didn't move, she bent over it&#x2014;her&#x2014;then fell to her knees.<br><br>The woman lay facedown. Lydia started to speak to her in Amish <em>Deutsche,</em> then saw by her short, curly hair&#x2014;blond hair iced with snow&#x2014;that she was <em>Eng-lische.</em><br><br>"Wake up. Hello? Are you all right? My name is Lydia Brand. I want to help you, <em>ya,</em> I do."<br><br>No answer, no movement. Unconscious? Dead? Had she opened the gate and come in? But from where? A narrow dirt lane, woodlot, fields and hills lay behind.<br><br>Lydia dusted off the woman's face as best she could and put her own nearly on the ground to get a better look at her. She didn't recognize the woman, wasn't even sure how old she was&#x2014;sixties? Older? Ripping off a mitten, Lydia touched the white, icy face with two fingers, then fumbled for a neck pulse. Couldn't tell. She had to get help soon&#x2014;now. She'd never be able to carry her. And if she dragged her through the snow, she might hurt her more.<br><br>The woman was not even wearing a scarf, hat or gloves, so was she off her bean? Clutched in her hand was a small, square piece of paper, like those sticky notes. Maybe it had her name on it or a message for someone. Lydia took it and held it close to her face. Words written in blue ink smeared the sodden paper. Not able to read it through the scrim of flakes, Lydia thrust it into the mitten she'd pulled back on, so the paper lay damp against her palm.<br><br>Panic pulsed through her as she took off her warm woolen cape and draped it over the woman, as if tucking her into bed. Josh would have to go for help in his buggy to the Stark family down the road, since they were <em>Englische</em> and had cars and phones. They could call the volunteer emergency squad and Sheriff Freeman.<br><br>Despite sweating in her frenzy, Lydia felt the gnawing cold even more without her cape. Could that woman have frozen to death? Fearing the flakes were turning to ice pellets, Lydia skimmed her hand along the wire fence, and calling out, "Melly! Melly!" stumbled through the deepening snow toward the barn.<br><br>Josh Yoder breathed a sigh of relief when the last camel, Melly, ambled into the barn, blinking ice crystals from her two-inch lashes and shaking the snow off her shaggy fur. He put her in her stall on camel row, then realized Lydia had not followed the big beast into the barn.<br><br>He ran back to the single tall door the camels used and pulled it back open. The wind howled at him, and snow fell like wool at shearing time. He had partly inherited this big, old milking barn from his father and had bought his brothers out. But it was no longer the Yoder Dairy. He'd kept four of the cows and acquired other animals to breed, but mostly he hired them out for living Christmas tableaux or holiday pageants in December. Spring through autumn, he ran a petting zoo, and a wagon pulled by his big Belgian horses took tourists on a ride so they could see and feed, and, of course, pet, the tamer animals in the back fields. But in wintertime he kept them inside.<br><br>Still no sign of Lydia. Surely, she'd have come in with Melly if she'd brought her back here. The barn was a shelter from the storm, a lofty, wide place with one long wing that held the old milking stanchions and rows of cattle stalls he planned to replace soon. The main building boasted two spacious haymows above the barn floor, one for fodder and straw and one to store other food supplies. He and his workers tried hard to keep the place clean. It actually managed to smell sweetly of straw, hay and warm bodies most of the winter. He only wished he'd known this sudden storm was coming.<br><br>Squinting against the spin of stinging snow&#x2014;ice pellets now&#x2014;and cupping his hands around his mouth, he bellowed out the door, "Lydia! Get in here! Don't you walk home in this! I'll take you in the sleigh or your parents will have my head. Lydia, get back here!"<br><br><em>Ach,</em> that woman was willful, always had been. But she was sure-footed and bright, too. At age twenty, she was a <em>maidal</em> who had blossomed into a beauty from the pesky, skinny tomboy she used to be. She was a distraction sometimes, bending over to feed the animals, humming, shooting those quick smiles at him. In the four years he'd been away from the Home Valley, she'd become a desirable woman, though one who would be a lot of trouble for the man she married. She was being courted by Gideon Reich, who worked for her father, so there was probably a wedding in the offing. Gideon was a widower, so maybe he knew a thing or two about women, but good luck to him taming Lydia Brand.<br><br>Really worried now&#x2014;could she have fallen or twisted an ankle out there?&#x2014;Josh grabbed his heavy coat and flap-eared hat. Should he just run outside, yelling for her? Harness Blaze onto the sleigh and try to catch her before she went into the thick woodlot that lay between his place and the Brand house?<br><br>Then he saw her emerge from the curtain of snow, half stumbling, half running. He rushed out and put an arm around her shaking shoulders. "What happened? Where's your cape?"<br><br>Her cheeks were pink with cold, her lips blue, her teeth chattering. At least she still wore mittens and boots. He picked her up and carried her toward the barn. Despite her trembling, she held tight to him.<br><br>"C-c-cape c-covered a woman, lying in the s-snow. By the back g-gate," she stuttered through chapped lips. "It was open, but I closed it."<br><br>He sat her at his worktable and put his coat around her. He poured hot chocolate from his thermos into a plastic cup and held it to her lips until she took a swallow and brought her mittened hands up to hold it. A woman out in the snow? And it upset him about the gate because he didn't need more <em>rumspringa</em> kids sneaking in to ride or scare the animals. The animals could get hurt and the kids, too, but what had happened to the woman?<br><br>"Not sure whether to take the sleigh for her or go to the Starks to get help," Josh muttered as he ran to harness his mare in the nearest corner of the barn.<br><br>"I'll g-go with you either way," she called after him.<br><br>"No, you stay here. Is she hurt? Alive?"<br><br>"Not sure. F-frozen, I think."<br><br>"You didn't recognize her?"<br><br>"No. Not Amish."<br><br>"No one else lost out there?"<br><br>"Don't know. I'll help you harness B-Blaze, then&#x2014;"<br><br>"Drink that. Stay put."<br><br>It would be quickest to take the sleigh. He'd refused to rent it out recently for a Santa pageant. When he'd returned after four years of working at the Columbus Zoo and joined the church, he'd promised Bishop Esh that the animals would be rented out strictly for religious events. He could go find someone to help. But no, he'd go check on the woman first.<br><br>He heard knocking and a shout at the far end of the barn, closest to the road. If only it was someone with a car or a cell phone! He paid his <em>Englische</em> friend Hank to do his bookings on his cell, but Josh wished he had his own now.<br><br>He sprinted the width of the barn, past the donkeys braying at the intrusion, and swung the door open. Lydia's father, Sol Brand, stood there. Snow etched his brimmed hat, narrow shoulders and graying beard. He was a head shorter than Josh. If any Amish man could be considered a loner in their friendly, tight church community, even though he worked with many people every day, it was Solomon Brand.<br><br>"Liddy here?" he asked, frowning, as he stepped inside. "Hope you didn't let her walk home in this." Beyond him Josh saw two horses hitched to a big buggy.<br><br>"She's here, Mr. Brand. She was out in the snow, but she stumbled on an injured or dead woman on her way back, and we need to get help. Since you're hitched up, could you go down the road to the Starks' and have them phone for help? I'll go out for the woman and, if she's alive, bring her back to the barn."<br><br>"Don't like to bother the Starks myself, but for this... How 'bout you take my buggy and go? Is it someone Amish?"<br><br>"A modern."<br><br>Sol frowned again at Josh as if that were his fault. "Liddy, you all right?" the older man bellowed so loud the donkeys began braying again.<br><br><em>"Ya, daad!"</em> she called, walking toward them. "Glad you came so you can help!"<br><br>Sol shook his head when he saw Lydia wrapped in Josh's coat. Josh knew the Brands didn't like their daughter spending hours working with his animals, especially on weekends like this. But she'd stood firm on helping here. Her father often came after her since they didn't want her out in her buggy after dark. No doubt her come-calling friend, Gideon Reich, didn't want her here, either, "dirtying her hands," as Josh had heard, but Lydia had a mind of her own. And, while her mother scolded her a lot, her father seemed to love her dearly.<br><br>"All right, I'll go," Sol told Josh. "Liddy, don't you go back out in the storm! I'll be right back&#x2014;let Connor Stark do the calling for help."<br><br>He lifted a quick hand to his daughter, turned and went back out. Josh had intentionally not mentioned where the woman lay, back by the gate to Creek Pond. Sol and Susan Brand's five-year-old son, Samuel, had drowned there when Lydia was about ten and Josh was twenty. He understood that was one of the reasons the Brands sheltered their remaining child. They had Lydia working during the week as the receptionist in their family-owned Amish furniture store on the edge of town, and, otherwise, tried to keep her close to home.<br><br>Josh hurried to Lydia and steered her back toward the worktable where she'd been sitting. "I can't believe <em>Daad</em> went to the Starks. He thinks they're prideful, even though they've bought a lot of our furniture."<br><br>"He's going, and I'm going to try to find the woman near the gate, bring her here. You wait here for the sheriff or the squad. If I'm not back and they need to drive vehicles out there, they should take the dirt road outside the fence, if they can find it in this snow. I've got Blaze half-hitched. Sit down here by the front door and rest."<br><br></p><h2>Listen to Your Gut: The Complete Natural Healing Program for IBS &amp; IBD, Revised Edition</h2><p>This revised and expanded version of expert Jini Patel Thompson&#39;s complete natural healing program for irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease includes a 480-page hardcover book and accompanying CD.

His protagonist is Charles Baudelaire: poet of "nerves," art love, pioneering critic, man about Paris. Calasso ranges through Baudelaire's life and work, focusing on two painters&#x2015;Ingres and Delacroix&#x2015;about whom Baudelaire wrote acutely, and then turns to Degas and Manet, who followed in the tracks Baudelaire laid down in his great essay <i>The Painter of Modern Life</i>. In Calasso's lavishly illustrated mosaic of stories, insights, close readings of poems, and commentaries on paintings, Baudelaire's Paris comes brilliantly to life. </p><p> In the eighteenth century, a <i>Folie</i> was a garden pavilion set aside for people of leisure, a place of delight and fantasy. Following Baudelaire, Calasso has created a brilliant and dramatic "Folie Baudelaire"&#x2015;a place where the reader can encounter the poet himself, his peers, his city, and his extraordinary likes and dislikes, finally discovering that that places is situated in the middle of the land of "absolute literature."</p></p><p><p><b>Roberto Calasso</b>, publisher of Adelphi in Milan, is the author of many books, among them <i>The Ruin of Kasch</i>, <i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>, <i>Ka</i>, <i>K.</i>, and <i>Tiepolo Pink</i>, all parts of a work in progress of which <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is the sixth panel.</p><br><br><p><b>Alastair McEwen</b> has translated almost ninety books of fiction and nonfiction and seven feature film scripts, as well as radio play adaptations, operative librettos, and many hundreds of articles for various magazines and newspapers. He has also translated some of Italy's finest writers (Calasso, Eco, Tabucchi, and many others). He lives and works in Milan.</p><p>&#x201c;Roberto Calasso's book, written in magnificent and supple prose and illustrated with reproductions of often little-known works of art, responds admirably to its title: it's the most absorbing guided visit that one could imagine of the brothel-museum of Baudelaire's dreams . . . One exits amazed by the intelligence and erudition of the guide, the foremost expert on a romantic and decadent Paris in which the rococo and neo-classical epochs remained living and present under the surface. And silently running throughout this account are the contradictory facets of the most gifted man in Paris at that time, Baudelaire, lover and critic of art, poet, journalist, bohemian, and dandy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marc Fumaroli, Commentaire</i></p><p>&#x201c;Roberto Calasso [is] the most inquisitively suggestive literary critic in the world today . . . <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is no narrow study of the poet's work or, even worse, a birth-to-death biography. Rather, by associating the poet with the prominent writers and artists with whom he came into contact, Calasso has created what he calls &#x2018;analogical history . . . an ever-more-urgent desideratum in an intellectually debilitated epoch such as the present.' A questioning assault upon the received wisdom, it exposes the hollow triumph of Impressionism and its artists, Renoir, Manet, Monet and Degas, over an implacable academy . . . the deeper purpose of Calasso's project can be glimpsed: a subtle inquiry into how the 19th century, and the popular description of it as a century of startling liberatory artistic promise and vast industrial progress, could give birth to a next century defined by Auschwitz, the gulag and Hiroshima.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas McGonigle, The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso captures [Baudelaire's] shifting, overlapping world, never seeming overwhelmed by his material. Certain anecdotes stand out. Calasso is not afraid to show these figures as occasionally absurd. Ingres, a &#x2018;compact and stocky' man &#x2018;devoid of a sense of the ridiculous,' runs through his studio to launch himself on to a mattress in order to create interesting folds in a drape. Degas, a keen user of early photography, tries to capture the moon, only to find it &#x2018;moved too much.' Calasso also collects stories of supporting characters--from Degas's housekeeper to Baudelaire's mistress--to evoke an entire world. Such details, combined with his ear for a lyrical phrase, make <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> a joy to read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Emma Hogan, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso['s] ... extravagant admiration and connective intuition make a book of equal brilliance out of a chain of fragmentary reflections--Walter Benjamin might have called them blinks--beginning and ending with Charles Baudelaire (1821-67), cast as the primary metaphysician of modernity: part-creator, part-revelator, part-enactor of our signature condition . . . Calasso emphasizes Baudelaire's clarity and originality (his &#x2018;firsttimeness'), his imperativeness and his fearlessness . . . [Calasso's] Baudelaire is a person, not to say a personage. Part of the fascination of his book is its biographical or prosopographical color. &#x2018;Baudelaire was a dandy, especially in ruin,' Calasso observes characteristically, evoking him at 32, walking too cautiously, for fear of widening the rips in his clothes. &#x2018;He is a first Buster Keaton in a frock coat, who moves off, slowly, through the streets of Paris.' . . . The highlight of this ambitious enterprise is the reading or rereading of certain painters and paintings, in Baudelairian perspective . . . arresting observations on painters and paintings alike, aided and abetted by some discriminatingly chosen illustrations, beautifully reproduced . . . Calasso is one of the few to do justice to Degas's rabid antisemitism. He is also a great noticer of things in the paintings . . . Roberto Calasso wends his way, inviolate. <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is bedazzling.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alex Danchev, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;From a masterful biographical portrait of Baudelaire, the narrative spins out . . . to consider subjects as myriad as the airlessness of Ingres's neoclassicism, Chateaubriand's complaints about &#x2018;the vulgarity . . . of passports' and the African exile of French poetry's enfant terrible, Arthur Rimbaud . . . his eye for illuminating anecdote is peerless. Thus he informs us of Alberthe de Rubempr� who &#x2018;was the mistress, in rapid succession, of Delacroix, Stendhal and M�rim�e,' before waspishly adding: &#x2018;Each of them spoke too well of her to his best friend--and was then promptly ousted by him.' . . . <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is a concrete triumph, for its recreation of Baudelaire's milieu is so intensely vivid as to miraculously transform the distantly anecdotal into the seemingly actual.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lucian Robinson, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;What a rare and special book this is, from its opening paragraph . . . But then what a rare writer is the prolific, post-Calvino Italian master Roberto Calasso--72-year-old scholar, translator, author of film scripts, radio and television adaptations, operatic librettos and seemingly most other viable prose forms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries . . . [<i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is] an ideal introduction in English to one of the most urbane and readable of living masters.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeff Simon, Buffalo News</i></p><p>&#x201c;In a series of elegant, passionate, erudite books, Calasso has attempted to map out an esoteric terrain: the metaphysical in literature. This study of Baudelaire and his era therefore represents a new stage in his project, developing from one of the essays in his Oxford lecture series, published as <i>Literature and the Gods</i>: an attempt to show how the metaphysical is still present, if in an occluded and buried form, even at the point when modernist literature begins . . . [Calasso's] book is baroque in its construction: its argument does not proceed from point to point but through a sequence of slow drifts and sudden aphoristic shocks. It is a gorgeous, willful, and convincing re-staging of Baudelaire's style . . . Toward the end of his book Calasso offers a final definition of his style: &#x2018;an audacity that came naturally to Baudelaire no less than did a certain wavelike motion of verse. And it is precisely the alternation between those two tempos--the prestissimo of provocation and the sforzato of the Alexandrine--that separates him from all those who came before him and those who were to follow him.' Or, to put this another way, he was revolutionary, sure--and yet, as Calasso observes beautifully, &#x2018;all his poetry seems translated from Latin.' Baudelaire was a classicist in his investigation of corruption. He was a constant double agent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Thirlwell, The New Republic</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso's book can be seen as a series of spirited improvisations on the theme expressed in Walter Benjamin's essays on Baudelaire: that the poet, though he remained resolutely in the Romantic tradition, was the first to express the dark new reality of what Benjamin called &#x2018;the permanent catastrophe' of life after the Industrial Revolution. Calasso illuminates this image of Baudelaire: the first poet to describe the shocking beauty of a decomposing corpse; to define the mixture of disgust, boredom, alienation, and fear that hung like a permanent fever mist in the brain of the city-dweller; to glory in the allure of the unhealthy, perverse and deformed, of the artificial and mechanical, of dissonance and fragmentation--all the scenery of destruction and despair that would become the natural landscape of writers from Kafka to Sartre and onward . . . Smoothing the way is the curiously conversational tone in which even the most arcane information is conveyed, as well as the underlying sense that, as the author piles detail upon detail, he's having a huge amount of fun. Calasso may identify with his hero, but there is no Baudelairean melancholy in his work. There's no show-off either--only a sincere delight, an innocent reveling in his own encyclopedic mind at play. This mood is catching, and if one adopts the right dreamy pace, one can commune with Calasso through a kind of imaginative osmosis.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrea Lee, Page-Turner (Newyorker.com)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Roberto Calasso is] an ambitious artist-critic, pushing the subject as far as he can, bent on penetrating the mind of both Baudelaire and his time.

It is as red-blooded as art criticism gets, and a suitable encomium for the greatest of art critics.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jad Adams, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;Let us lavish praise where praise is due: Roberto Calasso is the pre-eminent public intellectual of Western Europe, and perhaps the Western world. His extensive writings aim at nothing less than the recovery and reappropriation of the foundations of civilization. And he pursues his aim by reshaping and redirecting our vision toward the often obscure, but profoundly rich, synthesis of art, philosophy, literature and cultural theory that lies at the root of our identities . . . [In <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i>] he turns his formidable intellect to the birth of an era closer to home: the modern . . . [Calasso is] brilliant . . . pervasive in his studies . . . inventive in his narrative structure . . . Always surprising, never predictable, Calasso picks a progenitor of modernity that none of us would suspect . . . Charles Baudelaire, the Parisian enfant terrible, emblem of decadence and damnation to the status quo. Such eccentricity on Calasso's part allows "La Folie Baudelaire" to shine forth as his most accessible, satisfying book . . . to read Calasso's beautiful synthesis of the age in which Baudelaire flourished is to understand the poet as a Virgil to our Dante--exploring the labyrinthine depths of modernity's cult of endless images . . . For we moderns, as Calasso elegantly and authoritatively demonstrates, and as Baudelaire foretold: <i>The future is now</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Arlice Davenport, The Wichita Eagle</i></p><p>&#x201c;Don't expect anything so obvious as a thesis; what we get instead is a companionable guided tour of mid- and late 19th century Paris, loosely organized around Baudelaire, his associates and enthusiasms, and the idea . . . that what we like to think of as the modern sensibility (urban, alienated, etc.) first recognized itself in that time and place. Perhaps not surprisingly, more than a touch of the <i>flaneur</i> hovers over the proceedings. Rambling across decades and art forms, Calasso--a polymathic one-man genre whose previous books have soared in the loftiest realms where culture intersects with ritual and myth--finds room, this time around, for jokes about Belgium and digressions on mistresses and breasts.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeff Tompkins, PopMatters</i></p><p>&#x201c;At his best, Calasso is a writer of sufficient force and grace not only to summon the gods, but to make them come. A brief biographical note to Calasso's latest book describes the publication as &#x2018;the sixth panel' of &#x2018;a work in progress.' Calasso has been laboring at this project for 25 years, and his work to date . . . constitutes a major critical accomplishment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Algis Valiunas, The Weekly Standard</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Calasso] has certainly managed to open a new road through the old landscape of literature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Banville, The New York Review of Books on Roberto Calasso</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>] is the kind of book one comes across only once or twice in one's lifetime . . . Is this, then, the work of a Mediterranean genius? Of a genius, that's certain. And it's all Calasso's own . . .

His book certainly is.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Joseph Brodsky on Roberto Calasso</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso is not only immensely learned; he is one of the most original thinkers and writers we have today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Charles Simic on Roberto Calasso</i></p><p>&#x201c;Roberto Calasso [is] an exceptionally accessible thinker, original and profound . . .

I knew that what I had been doing simply wasn&#x2019;t working, and it wasn&#x2019;t for lack of effort. I read the self-help books, I studied the financial courses, I strived to improve myself and my financial reality, but nothing seemed to &#x201c;click.&#x201d; </p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until I discovered EFT Tapping that everything changed for me. It was at that moment that I began to realize that what I had always thought was an &#x201c;outer game&#x201d;&#x2014;working harder, getting lucky breaks, the economy&#x2014;was really much more of an &#x201c;inner game,&#x201d; as were my perceptions, decisions, belief systems, traumas, and more.</p><p> That awareness is a fantastic first step toward changing, but the question then remains, &#x201c;How do I actually change? I know I&#x2019;ve got some bad patterns, belief systems, and traumas, but what do I do about it?&#x201d; This is where Tapping comes to the rescue, in extraordinary ways. </p><p>When I began Tapping in 2004, it helped me to clear out that old junk and create a new reality for myself. The documentary film about EFT&#x2014;<i>The Tapping Solution</i>, now also a <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling book&#x2014;which I set off to make in 2007, was a project inspired by a new way of being, a new reality, that said all things are possible, that I could make my dreams come true, and that I not only could provide incredible value and contributions to the world but could also be financially rewarded for them.</p><p>After I began Tapping to change my financial reality, the last six years of my life have been simply extraordinary. And I credit the success to the time I spent taking a close hard look at my financial beliefs and using Tapping to change them. This simple, scientifically validated process has made all the difference in my life, and it can do the same for you.</p><p>So I can guarantee you that there is no more powerful tool in the world to actualize change than Tapping. But there are times when the tool isn&#x2019;t enough, when you need the guidance, care, and nurturing of a powerful mentor who can pinpoint exactly where you need to go, what you need to explore, in order to get the fastest results possible.</p><p>And this is where my friend Margaret Lynch and this amazing book come in. Sure, you can learn the Tapping basics and use the process on your own. But it&#x2019;s likely to take longer, be more difficult, and generate results that are less powerful than what you will achieve with the laser-focused guidance of an expert like Margaret Lynch.</p><p>I met Margaret in 2008, at the dawn of both of our EFT &#x201c;careers.&#x201d; Her bright smile and engaging personality instantly attracted me to her, and after spending time with her, I quickly learned that not only did Margaret exude success and confidence but she also had a deep understanding of money, finances, goal-setting, and all the key elements to creating lasting success. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve watched Margaret during the past several years as she&#x2019;s continued to innovate on EFT, bringing a new and profound sense of clarity and enthusiasm, as well as impressive results, to this work. And with this book, she&#x2019;s taken all of that to the next level. </p><p>You hold in your hands the opportunity to be personally mentored by one of the smartest ladies I know. (She&#x2019;s coached me personally one-on-one on many occasions.) Her insights and her understanding of the material are unparalleled and can help you to quickly and efficiently change your financial reality. </p><p>So sit back, relax, get comfy, start Tapping, and begin the journey to finally unleashing your creative potential, following your dreams and passions, and creating a life of success and abundance!</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>W<i>hy don&#x2019;t I have more money?</i> I hear that over and over from people who are frustrated about feeling stuck in an income bracket, despite their strong desire and best efforts to have a lot more. Many work harder, yet don&#x2019;t reap the rewards of it. Others use the popular New Age idea of the Law of Attraction to create more wealth by consciously focusing their thoughts on it (more on this in chapter 1), but wonder why this doesn&#x2019;t end up working for them. Most feel frustrated, disappointed, and down on themselves for their inability to generate a larger income. Then the blame and excuses begin:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me that I can&#x2019;t make more money?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&#x201c;What have I done to deserve this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to make more money!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Etc., etc.<br><p>These negative messages and emotions reinforce what you <i>don&#x2019;t</i> want. It&#x2019;s time to change the dynamics between you and money! I wrote this book to help you overcome the main factors that block financial freedom by using powerful techniques. The power to change your money situation is in your hands, or more specifically, in your mind. It doesn&#x2019;t matter what&#x2019;s in your bank account or what your current income is. If you&#x2019;re willing to explore how past experiences create your current view of money, and release them, you can open the door to more money than you can imagine having. I personally built my current career using the strategies in this book. You can too! Once you understand what I teach you, the power to take charge of and <i>greatly</i> increase how much wealth you create and amass will be yours. I want you to be rich!</p><p>Unlike many well-known coaches using mind/body approaches, I come from a science and business background. I earned a bachelor of science in chemical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts and approach mind/body techniques with the practical mind-set of an engineer. After eighteen-plus years of management and executive sales experience at Fortune 500 companies, I decided to change my career path to become a success coach and had to deal with my own blocks against money and wealth.</p><p>My engineering background drew me to the new science of energy medicine, and I became a certified EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) Practitioner. EFT, which is also known as Tapping (more on this in chapter 2), requires using fingertips to tap on a specific series of acupuncture points while emotionally tuning in to limiting beliefs or negative experiences, and expressing feelings about them as you tap on these points. This mind/body technique lets you access your subconscious mind and physically release blocks. I started using EFT for myself and experienced major shifts in my attitudes, actions, and confidence.</p><p>When I began my business, New England Success Coaching, I had great expectations of success, especially because I was armed with this powerful technique. But as the months went by, I experienced fear, frustration, shame, and sadness about never quite making enough. I operated in survival mode&#x2014;trying to make enough to pay my bills and survive, genuinely surprised at how difficult it was to earn a good living. Many smart, hardworking, well-intentioned individuals came to me for help. They were also stressed over their money situations&#x2014;struggling simultaneously to make ends meet, enjoy life, and expand their business, talents, and lifestyle. They wanted to work with me on their confidence or public speaking and eliminate their stress, anxiety, or upsetting memories from the past. I observed how well they hid their private financial hell that in many cases was the source of their constant fear, pressure, and insecurity.</p><p>Many of these people were open-minded and had done lots of personal development work, but were still limited by money in their personal lives and businesses. This kept them stressed, stuck in fear, and held them back from enjoying life and making more of an effort to use their unique gifts and talents. The limitations in their wealth picture rippled out into all aspects of their lives, affecting their health, family, and career. It became clear that the common denominator in all my clients was struggle and limitation related to money, which meant that specific blocks to money were playing a significant role.</p><p>These blocks and limiting beliefs about money completely dictated their entire wealth picture&#x2014;income, savings, the goals they set, and even how much debt they had. Many of these people were some of the greatest, most passionate, and talented people I&#x2019;d ever met, which contributed to how much it bothered me. It just seemed wrong and unfair that such smart, positive, and willing people would struggle so much with money. It also hit very close to home, as I was experiencing similar struggles in my new business.</p><p>This frustration drove me to go deeper and figure out how to uncover and release blocks very specific to money and wealth. It pushed me to delve into my own internal blocks and into every teaching I could find about the subject. I discovered that at the core of limiting beliefs, struggles, and self-sabotage in relation to money are negative vows made unconsciously around money and wealth. Most originated long ago, usually in childhood, and have long since been forgotten on a conscious level. I studied patterns that I observed of how people handled their money and their attitudes to having money in general, and discovered how easy it is to recognize money blocks once you know where to look.</p><p>Tapping, combined with my research that specifically focused on money and wealth, made the clearing of money blocks a phenomenal success for me and for my clients. &#x201c;Aha&#x201d; moments gave people insight as they looked back at their lives and finally understood why they made mistakes related to money and success. This understanding allowed them to clear their specific blocks and limiting attitudes toward money so they could manifest more money and success with true freedom of choice. From that enlightenment, I created programs packed with tools to clear every block that limits and sabotages wealth. And it worked! Within a few years I rose to the top of my profession as a leading worldwide expert in EFT/Tapping for money.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s economic climate, a mind/body approach to money is more essential than ever! As you look at the world, you&#x2019;ve seen the financial systems across the globe break down. Like old buildings, their structures are collapsing and need to be rebuilt, since most are based on a foundation of rules, beliefs, and ways of operating that are outdated, rarely questioned, and in many cases corrupt. And here&#x2019;s the real kicker: you reflect them. Imagine that you have an inner financial system like a city of old structures. Until now, your entire personal financial picture was built on these structures&#x2014;a foundation of rules, beliefs, and ways of operating that are outdated, and often corrupted by shame, self-doubt, fear, and other negative emotions.</p><p>These inner tenets are as solid, rigid, and real as steel girders and cement foundations. Like a city of old buildings, they must be deconstructed to build a new wealth reality that supports your real life purpose. You can do it! While some doors close, huge new doors of opportunities are opening when you&#x2019;re ready to step through. I stepped through one when I left corporate America and became free of the zombie-job and fear of layoffs. But in order to succeed, I needed to do two key things:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Deconstruct my inner financial buildings and upgrade my money operating systems<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Take a huge step up in my personal power, to increase enthusiasm, energy, brilliance, action, charisma, and choice<br><p>How huge is the step up you&#x2019;re willing to take to make more money? It will have to match the size of your goals for your mission and wealth. When I first started my business, I had an outrageous vision, so my steps had to be big and bold&#x2014;and they were, once I got rid of the weight of my resistance to success. A key question to ask yourself is, &#x201c;Have I reached my tipping point of pain yet, or does my life path still seem okay?&#x201d; Are you frustrated about your financial situation or closer to outrage? Or are you just plain sick of it? If you have any or all of these emotions, or are just at a point where you&#x2019;re ready to have more money, read on! I&#x2019;m thrilled to be able to help you open your own doors to increased wealth.</p><p>Throughout the book, I explain how to recognize where your blocks come from. First, I&#x2019;ll introduce you to the mind/body connection to money and how it affects your finances. I&#x2019;ll explain what Tapping is and how you can do it on your own. Then I&#x2019;ll present experiential exercises you can do that will help reveal your real beliefs and emotions about money and why you need to get serious about having a lot more. We&#x2019;ll examine hidden fears about the downsides of having a lot of money and how you might sabotage your ability to increase wealth by overspending, making bad investments, not managing bill payments, and the like. I&#x2019;ll also include guidance for resetting your wealth set point by shifting your subconscious beliefs about the limit of how much money you should have, which keeps you stuck. By the end of the book, you&#x2019;ll know why you don&#x2019;t have more money, and how you can shift that. Then you&#x2019;ll be ready to take the real steps to change.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve helped thousands of people identify their resistance to getting lots of money, and use Tapping to clear blocks. Now I want to help <i>you</i> answer the question &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I have more money?&#x201d; so you can find and clear your own blocks and make a lot more money! Most chapters have specific exercises to help you get clarity about each lesson, as well as sample scripts to guide you as you use Tapping to clear blocks. I want to help you step out of what might seem a hopeless financial hell and open the door to a new wealth reality. You can do it!

Dr. John Sarno&#x2019;s best-selling books, including <i>Mind Over Back Pain</i>, and Louise L. Hay&#x2019;s book <i>You Can Heal Your Life</i> discuss a mind/body connection between negative emotions and illness and how to use it to ease or let go of health problems. I use the same principles for increasing wealth.</p><p>If you want to greatly increase your wealth, it&#x2019;s important to recognize that money has a mind/body component. You can harness this to take control of and increase how much you have. But using it isn&#x2019;t as effortless as it may sound. It requires you to look within for answers, and face old memories or limiting beliefs that could be painful. Finding your personal mind/body connection to money can be the hardest part of this journey, but when you do find it, the rewards can reflect enormously in your bank account.</p><p>Isn&#x2019;t Using the Law of Attraction Enough?</p><p>When Oprah featured people from the DVD for <i>The Secret</i> on her show, people rushed to manifest their desires, using what was explained about the Law of Attraction.

But there are times, and surely the present is one of them, when to do so is manifestly unnecessary. In an age when every standard of decent conduct has either been torn down or is threatened with destruction; when every newspaper is daily reporting scenes of violence, divorce, and arson; when quite young girls smoke cigarettes and even, I am assured, sometimes cigars; when mature women, the mothers of unhappy children, enter the sea in one-piece bathing-costumes; and when married men, the heads of households, prefer the flicker of the cinematograph to the Athanasian Creed -- then it is obviously a task, not to be justifiably avoided, to place some higher example before the world. For some time -- I am now forty-seven -- I had been feeling this with increasing urgency. And when not only my wife and her four sisters, but the vicar of my parish, the Reverend Simeon Whey, approached me with the same suggestion, I felt that delay would amount to sin. That sin, by many persons, is now lightly regarded, I am, of course, only too well aware. That its very existence is denied by others is a fact equally familiar to me. But I am not one of them. On every ground I am an unflinching opponent of sin. I have continually rebuked it in others. I have strictly refrained from it in myself. And for that reason alone I have deemed it incumbent upon me to issue this volume.</p><p>A Churchwarden, Sunday school superintendent, and President of the St Potamus Purity League, Augustus Carp is assiduous in exposing the sins and foibles of others while studiously ignoring his own. Although he campaigns against lechery, drinking, and smoking, he manages to indulge himself in plenty of other vices in the name of piety. The more seriously Carp takes himself, the more ridiculous he becomes. His frequent falls from dignity are uproarious: from his inability to climb off buses without falling over to his lifelong problems with flatulence.

First published in 1959, The Manchurian Candidate is Condon&#39;s riveting take on a little-known corner of the cold war, the almost sci-fi concept of American soldiers captured, brainwashed, and programmed by their Chinese captors to return to the states as unsuspected political assassins. Condon&#39;s expert manipulation of the book&#39;s multiple themes ? from anticommunist hysteria to megalomaniacal motherhood ? makes this one of the most dazzling, and enduring, products of an unforgettable time.

Here he discusses the seeming scientific naivet� behind the creation story, God&#39;s love and goodness, and humanity&#39;s creation, its free will, and its blessedness. Bonhoeffer also tackles difficult questions that are raised from the first book of the Bible, questions about the seemingly redundant second story of creation, about God&#39;s own beginning, about the source of the light that was created the first day. The author then expounds upon Adam and Eve&#39;s fall from grace: How could they, creatures made in God&#39;s image, have thought to oppose God so foully? Where did the first evil come from? How did humanity lose its right to live in paradise? In &#34;Temptation,&#34; Bonhoeffer questions how temptation appeared in the midst of Eden&#39;s innocence, and he explores the very nature of evil. Bonhoeffer explains that Jesus Christ helps us to understand and conquer physical and spiritual temptation through His grace and goodness.</p><p></p><h2>Thee, Hannah!</h2><p>Nine-year-old Hannah, a Quaker living in Philadelphia just before the Civil War, longs to have some fashionable dresses like other girls but comes to appreciate her heritage and its plain dressing when her family saves the life of a runaway slave.</p><p></p><h2>Wild Town</h2><p>The place is a frontier boom town where the graft gets collected more regularly than the trash.

He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>Hidden Histories in the United Church of Christ</h2><p><p>This collection of essays expands knowledge about the diversity of the UCC, and connects the UCC with many significant developments in American religious and ethnic history.

Her image has ravished Western viewers ever since a magnificent limestone bust unearthed at the royal retreat of Amarna went on display in Berlin in 1924. But frustratingly few facts are known about this woman who lived more than three millennia ago. As she did in <i>Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh</i>, British archeologist Joyce Tyldesley makes a virtue of necessity by writing a book that is as much a cultural history as a biography. As Akhenaton swept away the plethora of old gods, dismaying many of his subjects, he needed a strong female figure to soften the abstract austerity of Aten, the sun deity; his beautiful queen was celebrated in official art and inscriptions that focused on the domestic life of the royal family. Tyldesley meticulously analyzes this iconography to evaluate Nefertiti's position in Egypt and her importance to her husband, who clearly cherished her beyond the demands of propriety or political necessity. The author cannot give readers a strong sense of Nefertiti's personality--the evidence simply isn't there--but she paints a wonderfully evocative picture of life at the civilized heart of the ancient world. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Joyce Tyldesley was born in Bolton, Lancashire. She gained a first-class honours degree in archaeology from liverpool University and a doctorate from Oxford. She is now Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Oriental Studies at Liverpool University and a freelance writer and lecturer on Egyptian archaeology. Her most recent book, HATCHEPSUT: THE FEMALE PHAROAH was published to much acclaim.</p><h2>Psychedelia and Other Colours</h2><p>In <i>Psychedelia and Other Colours</i>, acclaimed author Rob Chapman explores in crystalline detail the history, precedents and cultural impact of LSD, from the earliest experiments in painting with light and immersive environments to the thriving avant-garde scene that existed in San Francisco even before the Grateful Dead and the Fillmore Auditorium. In the U.K., he documents an entirely different history, and one that has never been told before.

Green, a preeminent veterinarian, horse trader, and storyteller of the twentieth-century Southwest, traded, raised, treated, and used horses throughout his life. A native of Cumby, Texas, Green grew up in the north-central part of the state and completed his first horse trade when he was in the third grade. He studied veterinary medicine at Cornell University and did postgraduate work at the Royal College of Veterinary Medicine in England. Green traveled throughout the world raising, breeding, and trading horses, mules, and cattle, and gained international recognition as a world-class horse judge.<br>For many years, Green worked as a veterinarian in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, where he began his research on the color of horses that culminated in this book. Green wrote several other best-selling books about his half-century of experience with horses, cattle, and people, including <i>A Thousand Miles of Mustangin', Wild Cow Tales, The Village Horse Doctor,</i> and <i>Horse Conformation.</i><br>A legend among horse enthusiasts and readers worldwide, Green received awards from the Texas Institute of Letters and the National Cowboy Hall of Fame for contributions to the literature of the Southwest.

Succeeding generations of Americans followed the Pilgrims' lead, until by the middle of the 20th century the wolf was driven to the verge of extinction nearly everywhere outside Alaska. Rick McIntyre, a seasonal park ranger at Denali, Yellowstone, and other wolf-populated areas, has spent years documenting the behavior of living wolves. Here he turns to the sad task of documenting America's destruction of the wolf, a legacy that we may finally be able to undo with the reintroduction of <i>Canis lupus</i> to the wild.America's "final solution" to the "wolf question" began with the colonists' guns and intensified through private and state bounties until, by 1919, when wolf extermination was federally mandated, Native Americans were essentially alone in espousing a respectful coexistence with this animal possessed of many attributes valued by humans: intelligence, courage, and family loyalty. McIntyre documents that wolves were frequently regarded, irrationally, with fear, loathing, and superstition, and he integrates narratives, legends, poems, news accounts, government documents, and photographs in detailing the execution, often with horrifying cruelty, of government-sanctioned "predator control" practices. In the 1920s, however, biologists began to criticize this mindset, and, since passage of the Endangered Species Act, public attitudes have also changed. McIntyre describes current efforts to reintroduce wolves onto public lands and attempts by ranchers and hunters to block reintroduction. An excellent resource book and an optimistic exploration of the changing fortune of this vital predator. <i>Brenda Grazis</i></p><h2>The Mind Of The Traveler</h2><p>Discusses the traditions of travel in the Western world, including heroic journeys, pilgrimages, and scientific expeditions, the influence of travel on identity, travelling peoples, and the effect of travel and travellers on society</p><p>Mourning the demise of "real" travel that is no longer "heroic or individualizing," Leed ( No Man's Land , LJ 5/15/79) is saddened at the ease with which modern travelers move around the globe, taking no risks and facing no unknowns. His study centers around the premise that prior to the breakdown of global barriers, travel was not only movement from place to place but a transforming event filled with historical and psychological significance. He supports his ideas with examples from epic literature (Gilgamesh and Odysseus), medieval tales of wandering knights, and travel journals of explorers and adventurers. These travel experiences are examined from a theoretical psychological perspective which analyzes the stages of a journey and the relationship between travel and identity. This is a demanding, scholarly work which presumes a knowledge of literature, history, and psychology. Recommended only for graduate school collections.<br><i>- Marlene M. Kuhl, Baltimore Cty.

Truman Capote, the enfant terrible, whose finely wrought fiction and nonfiction captured the nation's imagination. Gore Vidal, the wry, withering chronicler of politics, sex, and history. Tennessee Williams, whose powerful plays rocketed him to the top of the American theater. James Baldwin, the harrowingly perceptive novelist and social critic. Christopher Isherwood, the English novelist who became a thoroughly American novelist. And the exuberant Allen Ginsberg, whose poetry defied censorship and exploded minds. Together, their writing introduced America to gay experience and sensibility, and changed our literary culture. <br><br> But the change was only beginning. A new generation of gay writers followed, taking more risks and writing about their sexuality more openly. Edward Albee brought his prickly iconoclasm to the American theater. Edmund White laid bare his own life in stylized, autobiographical works. Armistead Maupin wove a rich tapestry of the counterculture, queer and straight. Mart Crowley brought gay men's lives out of the closet and onto the stage. And Tony Kushner took them beyond the stage, to the center of American ideas. <br><br> With authority and humor, Christopher Bram weaves these men's ambitions, affairs, feuds, loves, and appetites into a single sweeping narrative. Chronicling over fifty years of momentous change-from civil rights to Stonewall to AIDS and beyond-<b>EMINENT OUTLAWS</b> is an inspiring, illuminating tale: one that reveals how the lives of these men are crucial to understanding the social and cultural history of the American twentieth century.</p><p>Christopher Bram is the author of nine novels, including <i>Gods and Monsters</i> (originally titled <i>Father of Frankenstein</i>), which was made into an Academy Award-winning film. Bram was a 2001 Guggenheim Fellow and received the 2003 Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement. He lives in New York City."<i>Eminent Outlaws</i> is a spectacular overview of our gay literary history."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Instinct</i> Magazine</i></b><br><br>"Bram does a terrific job in cataloguing the lives of these important figures, from Vidal to James Baldwin to Michael Cunningham. He reveals their often tortured interior lives. His examinations of the works themselves are original and thoughtful. Eminent Outlaws is entertaining and informative, packed with interesting gossip and opinions."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Columbia Journalism Review</i></i></b><br><br>"As Bram's high-sounding subtitle promises-and these lives from Vidal through Baldwin and O'Hara to White and Kushner deliver-gay lib began as a literary movement; the aesthetic was always political, too....EMINENT OUTLAWS is the next (last?) step in reporting on literary lives that traces back to the gay dinner parties of yore. Few would have it any other way."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Newsweek</i></i></b><br><br>"Argumentative and often resonant, and lit from below by a gossipy wit. But its power is less sentence by sentence than cumulative. You don't realize how much the details of these writers' books and difficult lives have touched you until the book's final chapters.... With 'Eminent Outlaws' he has filled a gap in our critical literature."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Bram's portraits of an often-reluctant gay literary vanguard is fascinating enough, but alongside a 50-year narrative of unexplored gay aesthetic, he also provides a parallel history of the gay-rights movement....Bram's bio-history is fun to read and will be the standard text of the defining era of gay literati glitterati."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Philadelphia Inquirer </i></i></b><br><br>"Bram uses a series of complex portraits of America's most influential gay literary lions to argue for their position in the pantheon of American culture.... Eminent Outlaws offers a crucial and fascinating overview of decades of American literary history."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Salon.com</i></i></b><br><br>"With keen insight into the essential relationship between storytelling and gay identity-as well as careful research into the journals, letters and books of America's great gay writers-Outlaws traces the cultural influence of gay literature throughout the second half of the 20th century.... Perhaps we have Bram's early sense of service as a boy scout to thank for the work he's done to preserve history in Outlaws. That Bram pulls it off with such style seems appropriate: it's a gay history, after all."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Next</i> Magazine</i></b></p><h2>The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World&#39;s Most Dramatic Rivers</h2><p>Hardcover, Harper &amp; Row, 1977, B &amp; W Illustrations</p><p></p><h2>Heartbroken: A Novel</h2><p><b>A Best Book of the Year (<i>Suspense Magazine</i>)<br><br>A <i>New York Daily News&nbsp;</i>Top New Thriller Novel<br><br>A <i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;Best New Book<br><br>"Stellar...

She&#x2019;d given one customer the wrong change. She&#x2019;d given another the wrong order. And now, as some little kid ran out of the bathroom without looking, cutting her off as she moved down the narrow hallway from the kitchen to the dining area, she felt the tray of ice waters slipping from her hands. She&#x2019;d stopped short to avoid a collision, but the glasses and the tray had not.<br><br>She watched the boy dart down the hallway, but everything else was in torturous slow motion. Four glass tumblers sailed though the air, water pluming, ice cubes suspended. The word &#x201c;no&#x201d; pulled and elongated in her mind. And then&#x2014;�the shattering crash. She backed away from the shimmering, slicing mess and stared at it. Oh, God. Oh, no. Why did some days start out bad and just get worse?<br><br>Angelo from the kitchen rushed out to help. He had a mop in one hand and a bucket in the other like some kind of diner rescue worker. Then Carol, the owner of the Blue Hen, came around the corner. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I dropped it,&#x201d; said Emily. Obviously. She wasn&#x2019;t going to bother getting into it about the kid. And how the bathroom door shouldn&#x2019;t open outward into the hallway. Or how people needed to heed the sign that read: Please open the door and exit slowly. Carol looked at the mess and put a plump, beautifully manicured hand to her forehead. Emily couldn&#x2019;t help but look at her rings&#x2014;�a big diamond engagement ring and a ruby &#x201c;family&#x201d; ring, as Carol had called it. They glittered like stars.<br><br>&#x201c;Let Angelo get it. The order for your four-�top is up. You fetch that, and I&#x2019;ll get more ice water,&#x201d; Carol said. Her tone was weary but not unkind. Carol was never that. &#x201c;Try to pull yourself together, Emily. I don&#x2019;t know what you have on your mind today. But it is definitely not your work.&#x201d;<br><br>Emily nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>Carol looked at Emily over the rim of her glasses. She had a nice face, round and pink-�cheeked, with pretty, darkly lashed blue eyes. Her body was short and soft&#x2014;�a mother&#x2019;s body. Carol was, in fact, a bit henlike, Emily thought, zaftig and proud, strutting about clucking. Emily wanted to put her head in Carol&#x2019;s lap and cry her a river.<br><br>&#x201c;So, what is it, hon?&#x201d; said Carol. &#x201c;You need to talk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Emily. She tried for a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Angelo was already on his knees, picking up big shards of glass with calloused hands.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Angelo,&#x201d; said Emily.<br><br>He looked up at her with his dark puppy-�dog eyes, big, devoted, and a little lovesick. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Angelo had a crush on Emily; she knew that. He gave her a wide grin, as though he liked being down on his knees for her. She felt a hot blush spread across her cheeks, and then she was chasing after Carol, who was talking to her. Carol had a fast, soft, but no-�nonsense way of communicating. She didn&#x2019;t care if you participated, only that you appeared to be listening.<br><br>&#x201c;When you get orders wrong, especially for someone like Barney, who comes here every single day at the same time for the same meal, it makes people feel like we don&#x2019;t know them, don&#x2019;t care about them. And if you work at T.G.I. Friday&#x2019;s or Chili&#x2019;s, maybe that doesn&#x2019;t matter so much. But here, at my restaurant, it matters&#x2014;�because it&#x2019;s precisely that kind of personal interaction that separates the chains from the independents. Also, when you give people the wrong change, it makes us seem either untrustworthy or incompetent. Do you understand that, Emily?&#x201d; Emily knew this wasn&#x2019;t an invitation to chime in. Carol went on.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, dropping things? Well, it happens. But it usually happens when we&#x2019;re not present. You&#x2019;re all flustered from a morning of mistakes. So I want you to take a few minutes, after you bring the food to your four-�top, and go out back and take a break. I&#x2019;ll cover your tables. Then come on back in like it&#x2019;s a brand-�new day, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>Emily found herself nodding vigorously, then running the four-�top order over to the family by the window. Pancakes for the girl, French toast for the boy, an egg-�white scramble with broccoli for the mom, and a chili-�cheese omelet with home fries and an extra side of bacon for the dad (boy, did he ever get a look from Mom over the menu when he ordered that). He looked like he could afford to take off a few, but not in an unhealthy, worrisome way. He was just a beefy guy who liked to eat. He probably had high cholesterol; that&#x2019;s why his wife had that kind of angry-�worried look on her face when Emily placed the plate in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; the mom said. &#x201c;That looks good.&#x201d; But what she meant was: Oh, honey, are you really going to eat that? At least that&#x2019;s what Emily thought. She was good at that, reading faces, body language. She felt like, a lot of the time, she knew what people were thinking even when they were saying something else altogether. She&#x2019;d always been that way.<br><br>After she ran a bottle of ketchup over to the table, she went out back like Carol had asked her to. She sat on the bench where everyone went for a smoke break, and looked up into the sky. The day was warm and humid, clouds high and white. A light breeze made the leaves of the tall oaks that towered above the parking-�lot fence dance and hiss. She took a deep breath, trying to shake it off, like Carol wanted.<br><br>Why do you want to go to that place and run around for that stu- pid cow?<br><br>That&#x2019;s what Dean had said to her this morning. He hadn&#x2019;t wanted her to go to work. He&#x2019;d wanted her to stay with him. He didn&#x2019;t like Carol. Dean didn&#x2019;t seem to like anyone Emily liked. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what that said about him.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll make more in a morning with me than you will in a week at the Fat Hen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Blue Hen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; he said. He&#x2019;d lit a cigarette even though he knew the smell made her sick in the morning. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to run around like that.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t like the idea of her waitressing. His mother was a waitress, and Dean didn&#x2019;t like Emily to do anything that reminded him of his mother.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s low-�class work,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Emily didn&#x2019;t think any honest work was &#x201c;low-�class,&#x201d; whatever that meant coming from Dean. Carol treated her with respect. The customers, maybe because the Blue Hen was not the cheapest restaurant in town, were mostly polite. They tipped well. And usually, Emily was not half bad at the whole waitress thing. She liked talking to people, being friendly, and chitchatting about this and that with the regulars. Carol always made sure Emily had a meal before or after her shift and told everyone to help themselves to coffee and hot chocolate. The Blue Hen was the nicest place Emily had ever worked.<br><br>Dean was mad at her when she left. That was why she&#x2019;d shown up to work all shaky and upset. Well, one of the reasons, anyway. She didn&#x2019;t like it when he was mad, but if she didn&#x2019;t go to work and bring in a regular paycheck, they didn&#x2019;t always make it week to week. Then she&#x2019;d have to borrow from her mother&#x2014;�which she couldn&#x2019;t do right now. And that was a whole other set of problems.<br><br>It was true that Dean could make a lot of money. But he didn&#x2019;t always, and somehow it seemed to be gone as quickly as it came in. Then, of course, there were the times when Dean disappeared for days. Once for a week. She hadn&#x2019;t expected him to come back that time. She wasn&#x2019;t as happy as she thought she&#x2019;d be when he finally did come home.<br><br>&#x201c;Feeling better?&#x201d;<br><br>Angelo had come to stand beside her. She looked up at him, and he smiled shyly, turned his eyes toward the sky. He was always sweet to her, and she felt an odd desire to slip her hand into his. He smelled like the lemon soap he used to clean the dishes.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks for cleaning up my mess,&#x201d; she said. She folded her hands in her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;No problem.&#x201d;<br><br>She sensed that he was about to say more but changed his mind. He&#x2019;d asked her out a couple of times. She told him she was living with someone. He&#x2019;d given up asking, but he still smiled at her a lot, hopeful. She&#x2019;d expected him to get angry or mean when she turned him down, but he didn&#x2019;t. He was just as kind to her as he always had been. For some reason, that made her think that he had a nice mom, someone who had taught him to respect women. She really liked that about Angelo.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Carol&#x2019;s going to need you back inside,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She has paperwork to do in the office.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Emily said.<br><br>Carol kept the week&#x2019;s cash receipts in a safe behind the desk in her office. She did all the paperwork during the day on Friday. On Friday night after closing, she took the money to the bank&#x2019;s after-�hours deposit slot. Emily had heard Carol&#x2019;s husband, Paul, complain about that. He thought they should take it every night on the way home, so there wasn&#x2019;t as much cash lying around. Carol had agreed. But as far as Emily could see, she hadn&#x2019;t started doing that.<br><br>Emily had noticed that Carol was a creature of habit, and everything had to be done the same way every day. She didn&#x2019;t like change. From setup to close-�up, everything&#x2014;�making the coffee, squeezing the orange juice, refilling the salt, pepper, and sugar dispensers, wiping down the counter and tables&#x2014;�was part of an exact ritual.<br><br>Emily liked that about Carol. She was predictable, reliable. There was no mystery to what she wanted, how she would react. It was such a comfort, because Emily seldom had any idea what was going to set Dean off. Or her mother. Emily never knew whether to expect kindness or cruelty from either of them. At the Blue Hen, there was only one rule. Work hard and be nice, and everything would go just fine. That should be the rule for life, too, Emily thought. But, of course, that wasn&#x2019;t how things went.<br><br>Once she was back inside the restaurant, it did feel like a new day. Emily let the rhythm of the place take her, and she was in the groove for the rest of her shift. No more mistakes. At the end of the day, Carol made her a meat-�loaf plate with mashed potatoes and gravy and a big helping of saut�ed vegetables. Emily wouldn&#x2019;t have said she was hungry, but she finished every last bite and felt like she could have eaten more. She saw Carol looking at her, and then the other woman came to sit across from her in the booth.<br><br>The Blue Hen was in the lull between breakfast and lunch, a few customers lingering over their meals&#x2014;�a mom spoon-�feeding oatmeal to a little boy, an old man reading a paper, a couple holding hands at the two-�top by the window.<br><br>&#x201c;How was it?&#x201d; asked Carol. She tapped on Emily&#x2019;s empty plate.<br><br>Emily would have lifted it and licked the gravy clean if she&#x2019;d been alone.<br><br>&#x201c;Horrible,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sending it back.&#x201d;<br><br>Carol smiled at her and patted her hand. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have breakfast.&#x201d;</p><h2>Revolt of the Rebel Angels: The Future of the Multiverse</h2><p>A rebel angel&#x2019;s perspective on the Lucifer Rebellion 203,000 years ago and her insight into its past and future effects on consciousness <br> <br>� Explores how the angelic revolt led to Earth&#x2019;s celestial quarantine for more than 200,000 years <br> <br>� Draws parallels between the Process Church and the Lucifer Rebellion <br> <br>� Describes the rise and fall of Lemuria in connection with the rebel angels <br> <br>� Reveals how the 100 million angels currently incarnated in human bodies can help with Earth&#x2019;s return to the Multiverse and the coming transformation of consciousness <br> <br>After 200 millennia of celestial quarantine in the wake of Lucifer&#x2019;s angelic revolt, Earth and the rebel angels isolated here are being welcomed back into the benevolent and caring Multiverse. With this redemption comes a massive transformation of consciousness and a reconnection to our cosmic destiny. But why did the angels revolt and how has that event shaped our planet&#x2019;s past and its future? <br> <br>Writing through Timothy Wyllie, rebel angel Georgia shares insights from her half a million years stationed on Earth as a watcher and from her part in the angelic revolution. She reveals details of the Lucifer Rebellion, including the role played by Planetary Prince Caligastia and his team of angelic administrators--thought by some to be the Nephilim or Anunnaki of Sumerian myth--who followed Lucifer into the rebellion, ultimately leading to the quarantine of Earth and 36 other planets. Interweaving her story with events from Wyllie&#x2019;s life, Georgia draws parallels between Wyllie&#x2019;s involvement with the Process Church in the 1960s and the events of the angelic rebellion and celestial quarantine. She explores the rise and fall of the island civilization of Lemuria, or Mu, as well as Atlantis and the Maya. <br> <br>Georgia reveals there are more than 100 million rebel angels currently granted mortal incarnation on Earth at all levels of society and in all countries--most of whom are still unaware of their angelic heritage. Now that we are free of Prince Caligastia&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes manipulations, the stage is set for the rebel angels to begin redeeming their past and help Earth realize its significance in the wondrous destiny of the Multiverse.</p><p>Trained as an architect, Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was a graphic artist and writer who, after a near-death experience in 1973, specialized in the study of non-human intelligences, such as angels, ETs, and dolphins. He was the author of several books, including <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and <i>Awakening of the Watchers</i>.Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was born in Great Britain and raised in London. Having wended his way through an English public school education and then seven years further study at college, he qualified as an architect. In the late 70s, Timothy began a systematic exploration of out-of-body states. This led to experiments in telepathic communication with dolphins and an open invitation to contact with nonphysical beings that continues to this day. During this time, he was also running his own business in New York City, marketing a system he had co-devised for storing and filing color photographs. He retired from the business community in 1981 and turned full time to his creative endeavors. As a musician, Timothy made several tapes of what he called "Bozon Music"--a True Age improvisational jazz, shamanic music of the heart--as well as a series of guided visualization and meditation tapes. Also an artist, he worked on a virtually endless progression of drawings of sacred landscape. It was what brought him most joy. Timothy traveled frequently to give lectures and seminars or to investigate sites and locations for his drawings. He is the author of <i>Ask Your Angels: A Practical Guide to Working with the Messengers of Heaven to Empower and Enrich Your Life</i>, <i>Dolphins, ETs &amp; Angels</i>, the Rebel Angels series of books featured below, and a co-author of <i>Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins &amp; Shamans</i>.</p><h2>Count of Monte Cristo</h2><p><p><b>A gorgeously-illustrated, faithful manga adaptation of Alexander Dumas&#x2019; beloved classic!</b></p><p>Set in the time just before Napoleon&#x2019;s return to power, this adventurous tale follows the trials and tribulations of Edmond Dant�s.

In 1957, Lawrence began a weekly column for the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, blending gardening lore and horticultural expertise gained from her own gardens in Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina, and from her many gardener friends. This book presents 132 of her beloved columns. Never before published in book form, they were chosen from the more than 700 pieces that she wrote for the <i>Observer</i> over fourteen years.<p></p><p>Lawrence exchanged plants and gardening tips with everyone from southern &#x201c;farm ladies&#x201d; trading bulbs in garden bulletins to prominent regional gardeners. She corresponded with nursery owners, everyday backyard gardeners, and literary luminaries such as Katharine White and Eudora Welty. Her books, including <i>A Southern Garden</i>, <i>The Little Bulbs</i>, and <i>Gardens in Winter</i>, inspired several generations of gardeners in the South and beyond. </p><p>The columns in this volume cover specific plants, such as sweet peas, hellebores, peonies, and the bamboo growing outside her living-room window, as well as broader topics including the usefulness of vines, the importance of daily pruning, and organic gardening. Like all of Lawrence&#x2019;s writing, these columns are peppered with references to conversations with neighbors and quotations from poetry, mythology, and correspondence. They brim with knowledge gained from a lifetime of experimenting in her gardens, from her visits to other gardens, and from her extensive reading.</p><p>Lawrence once wrote, &#x201c;Dirty fingernails are not the only requirement for growing plants. One must be as willing to study as to dig, for a knowledge of plants is acquired as much from books as from experience.&#x201d; As inspiring today as when they first appeared in the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>, the columns collected in <i>Beautiful at All Seasons</i> showcase not only Lawrence&#x2019;s vast knowledge but also her intimate, conversational writing style and her lifelong celebration of gardens and gardening.</p><p></p></p><p>"All gardeners will welcome this splendidly edited collection of essays by Elizabeth Lawrence. They will delight in her elegant prose and subtle humor and will marvel at her breadth of knowledge of plants and literature.

It was there that he learned the nine lessons that forever changed his life and prepared him for the chilling events narrated in his previous three books. His recollection was triggered by his first encounter in 1985, but for years still remained half-hidden in shadow. Only now has he begun to reconstruct these childhood summers spent in secret adventure, these summers that planted the seeds for his adult encounters with alien visitors. <p> Jumping between a child's-eye view and an adults hindsight, Strieber deftly weaves an adventure that stretches across decades, landing (or rather, lifting off) at the place his new life started when he met extraterrestrials. Strieber fans everywhere will not want to miss his haunting odyssey into the past and the startling new insights these memories provide about the meanings of his alien encounters and the future destiny of mankind.</p>Whitley Strieber lives in San Antonio, TX, with his wife and their cats.</p><h2>My Searching Heart</h2><p>1980 First Edition Paperback: &#34;My Searching Heart&#34; by Crying Wind (Author) Navajo History and Culture written wonderfully. 4.0 out of 5 stars 7 customer reviews</p><p></p><h2>The Success and Failure of Picasso</h2><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;At the height of his powers, Pablo Picasso was the artist as revolutionary, breaking through the niceties of form in order to mount a direct challenge to the values of his time. At the height of his fame, he was the artist as royalty: incalculably wealthy, universally idolized�&#x2c6;&#x2019;and wholly isolated.<br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;In this stunning critical assessment, John Berger�&#x2c6;&#x2019;one of this century's most insightful cultural historians�&#x2c6;&#x2019;trains his penetrating gaze upon this most prodigious and enigmatic painter and on the Spanish landscape and very particular culture that shpaed his life and work. Writing with a novelist's sensuous evocation of character and detail, and drawing on an erudition that embraces history, politics, and art, Berger follows Picasso from his childhood in Malaga to the Blue Period and Cubism, from the creation of <i>Guernica</i> to the pained etchings of his final years. He gives us the full measure of Picasso's triumphs and an unsparing reckoning of their cost�&#x2c6;&#x2019;in exile, in loneliness, and in a desolation that drove him, in his last works, into an old man's furious and desperate frenzy at the beauty of what he could no longer create.</p><p>John Berger was born in London in 1926. He is well known for his novels and stories as well as for his works of nonfiction, including several volumes of art criticism. His first novel, <i>A Painter of Our Time</i>, was published in 1958, and since then his books have included <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy <i>Into Their Labours</i>, and the novel <i>G.,</i> which won the Booker Prize in 1972. In 1962 he left Britain permanently, and lived in a small village in the French Alps. He died in 2017.</p><h2>The Santa Fe House: Historic Residences, Enchanting Adobes and Romantic Revivals</h2><p>This book presents in detail forty architecturally rich and picturesque houses, ranging from the earliest one-story adobe structures, with flat roofs and an emphasis on utility and simplicity, to today&#x2019;s "Santa Fe style," showing deep roots in Pueblo Indian, Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo traditions.

From the poem entitled "Mummies" in Ancient Egypt, children are told that when a pharaoh died, "they used a secret way/To keep his body from decay./They checked him out from head to toes/And pulled his brain out through his nose." They also learn that ancient Egyptian doctors treated an ill child by feeding him a skinned mouse. Elementary students thrive on facts of this kind, and these books are filled with them. Explicatory notes and pronunciations are included below each poem.

Rolfe's <i>Hadrian the Seventh</i>. He hadn't, but soon did, and found himself entranced by the novel -- "a masterpiece"-- and no less fascinated by the mysterious person of its all-but-forgotten creator. <i>The Quest for Corvo</i> is a hilarious and heartbreaking portrait of the strange Frederick Rolfe, self-appointed Baron Corvo, an artist, writer, and frustrated aspirant to the priesthood with a bottomless talent for self-destruction. But this singular work, subtitled "an experiment in biography," is also a remarkable self-portrait, a study of the obsession and sympathy that inspires the biographer's art.</p><p>A.J.A.&nbsp;Symons (1900-1941) pursued a wide variety of projects in his short life, writing and editing works on the verse of the 1890s, the history of the Nonesuch Press, and critical studies of various figures of note.

'The Quest for Corvo' is biography in the form of a detective story, and as such it is riveting....The surest formula for a masterpiece biography&#x2014;of which there are not that many&#x2014;is an extraordinary human being writing about a great one. In 'The Quest for Corvo' we have an utterly charming man writing on a madly eccentric one....A slender book, an odd book, a completely original book, [it] also represents a new method of writing biography that has never been copied." &nbsp;&#x2014;Joseph Epstein, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><h2>Batman &amp; the Monster Men</h2><p>Batman has spent his first year fighting organized crime, but nothing thus far in his early career has prepared him for the new menace facing Gotham--super-powered villains!</p><p>Matt Wagner is one of the most highly regarded creators in the comics business.

Batman's duties have multiplied in recent weeks as a series of unusually gruesome attacks have left at least one mutilated body floating in the sewer and have kept Julie waiting impatiently for Bruce. And of course, loan shark and mob boss Sal Maroni continues to wreak havoc among his clients. In cooperation with Captain Jim Gordon at Gotham PD, Batman gets the evidence he needs to discover the source of the vicious attacks&#x2013;genetically mutated monsters created by renegade Professor Hugo Strange, a man with a Napoleon complex and money on loan from Sal Maroni. When Julie's father becomes entangled with Maroni, Bruce's emotional investment rises, and Batman must do everything in his power to bring down Maroni.

If you want a leisurely, formidably well-documented account of Humphrey Bogart's legendary screen career and four marriages (including a happy final one to Lauren Bacall), this is it. A. M. Sperber conducted some 200 interviews with people who knew the actor before his death in 1994; Eric Lax draws on her seven years of research to create a nuanced, in-depth, elegantly written portrait of the man recently dubbed Hollywood's greatest star by <i>Premiere</i> magazine."A heavy before World War II, Humphrey Bogart became a heartthrob and a hero after it, Hollywood 's beau ideal of American masculinity. How did it happen, this unlikeliest of screen evolutions? <b>Bogart</b> shows how, when the moment came, a classic good boy stepped forward to become America's classic good bad man. In short, what Bogie had, where he got it, and where it took him - the last word on a legend." -- Jack Miles, author of <b>God: A Biography</b> <p> "I loved this book... Beyond Bogart it is a wonderful and intricate history of Hollywood, the actor's trade - and the enduring power of image." -- Richard Reeves, author of <b>President Kennedy</b> </p><p> "<i>Bogart</i> is instantly the definitive biography with new and sometimes disturbing information on the early life and Broadway apprenticeship, the booze, the marriages, the rough and tumble Warner years, the politics of Hollywood culminating in the blacklist, and the artistic triumph of a performer who came to represent far more than the roles he played. This is a compelling book for anyone interested in the movies, the personalities, and the issues that swirled around this icon of American popular culture.

This collection of stories chronicles his travels, the people he met and the landscape, not only in the American West, but also in Cambodia, Kashmir, and Chiapas, where he was a correspondent for National Public Radio. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>The signs that Scott Carrier was a writer and not an athlete showed up early. At the age of 12, Carrier was the free safety and captain of the defense on his football team. During one game he got his teammates into a huddle and told them he was going to do something different:<p> </p><blockquote>We're going to line up in a six-three, but as they get set I'm going to say a haiku, and I want you guys to start moving around, dance around, stand on your head, do whatever you want. We'll kill them. Ready, break!</blockquote><p> When the quarterback started his count, Carrier shouted, "The wind brings dry leaves enough to start a fire!" and his teammates froze. When asked by his coach what on earth he'd been doing, Carrier calmly replied, "We're running a haiku." When pressed for a rationale, he said simply, "It was just an idea. It didn't really work out like I thought it would. I'm ready to move on, if you are."</p><p> And move on he did, crisscrossing the country as a contributor for NPR for nearly two decades. Some of his radio pieces (as well as longer essays written for <i>Esquire</i> and <i>Harper's</i>) have been collected in <i>Running After Antelope</i>. Sometimes sad, sometimes haunting, often funny, Carrier writes about travels to war-torn areas, personal relationship crises, and, of course, his quest to chase down an antelope--thus perhaps validating his vertebrate-morphologist brother's so-called running hypothesis: that humans became upright in order to breathe better.</p><p> In the book's final essay, Carrier is chasing after an antelope he calls the Lone Male. His friends have kept the animal running for almost an hour when it crosses Carrier's path. Relatively fresh, he takes off after it, "And I laugh. I laugh and I run and it is, for sure, the best thing I've ever done. I have everything I need, the wilderness is unfolding in front of me."</p><p> In the end, little is resolved--the wars and relationships continue, the thesis remains unproven. But Carrier would be the first to remind us that the pursuit--be it for peace, love, or science--has a purpose unto itself. <i>Running After Antelope</i> celebrates that pursuit in engaging fashion. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Scott Carrier was born in Lawrence, Kansas.

Not even sacrilege is sacred to Adam Parfrey as he aims his poison pen at targets ranging from Andrea Dworkin to G.G. Allin. Articles on the sex lives of freaks, amputees, and Nazis are sure to offend someone you know, and they're oddly compelling reading as well. In fact, there's not a clunker in this volume of politically astute if overly nasty pieces. Not to be missed are the interesting series of articles on the militia movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, which defy easy categorization on the standard political chart by attacking the media's biases as well as the narrowness of the militia movements.<i>Cult Rapture</i> is fine reading for a cozy night around a post-nuclear hell pit.Reading this incendiary, offensive and fascinating collection from underground freelancer Parfrey (Apocalypse Culture) is like looking at pornography: it's a cheap thrill but a thrill nonetheless. In 21 articles, many reprinted from the San Diego Reader, one from the Village Voice, Parfrey surveys the carnival of American culture, from The Girlfriend Who Last Saw Elvis Alive Fan Club, run by a woman who wants to be the surrogate womb for Elvis's child, to A Cult of Sex-Obsessed Cripples, who will put anything anywhere, to G.G. Allin's world of sick violence and nasty court battles over Walter Keane's kitschy big-eyed waifs. Parfrey also covers conspiracy theorists, such as the group called Project Monarch, who believe that the government tortures children, then programs them to be its slaves, and Linda Thompson, who threatened to start lynching congressmen unless some Constitutional amendments, the IRS and the Brady Bill were eliminated. Parfrey reveals a certain sympathy for his subjects' conspiracy-mindedness in his final article, an "expose" of the Oklahoma City bombing in which he raises some valid questions about the still-mysterious event while showing that the Clinton administration needed the bombing to justify its crackdown on militias. Parfrey's own language is almost absurdly inflammatory ("the Christian militia man has become a scapegoat, a justification for intelligence agencies' headlong rush into technocratic dystopia... where every financial transaction is instantly monitored by computers operated by Fortune 500 and its omnipotent police force." A truly mean piece on Andrea Dworkin's radical feminism even includes Parfrey's attached apologies. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Murder of Reality: Hidden Symbolism of the Dragon (Serpentigena)</h2><p>The most academic and comprehensive study written on The Serpent Race with detailed information on the angelic lineage includes: The Watchers, Fallen Angels, Serpents, Lucifer, the Builders, and the Origins of the tribe of Israel.</p><p></p><h2>The Elusive Eden: A New History of California, Fourth Edition</h2><p>California is a region of rich geographic and human diversity.

The story opens with the man breaking out of a New York mental hospital and proceeds on a violent, bloody path back to Ireland. Alternating with this killer's progress are chapters describing his daughter's daily life in working-class Ulster. <p> Mr. McKinty writes close to the bone, taking the reader right inside his characters' heads so that each thought, each action, resonates in the mind almost as if it had been the reader's own. Given the harrowing lives these characters lead and the graphic depictions of violence throughout the book, <i>Orange Rhymes with Everything</i> can prove a disturbing read.</p>If James Joyce had got his start as a Belfast Protestant with more of an interest in politics and less of a sense of humor--but with all of his scatological obsessions intact--he might have given us something close to McKinty's grim debut novel. The gritty realism that seems to be the fashion in Britain and Ireland these days has cast a long shadow over the younger generation of writers, many of whom apparently feel compelled to mimic the obsessions of Irvine Welsh and James Kelman, just as young Americans have aped the simplicities of Hemingway for the last 50 years. McKinty's version of the new realism involves a walking tour of the uglier stretches of Belfast and New York, narrated from the points of view of a hunchbacked teenager and a terrorist who is very likely her father. The young girl, who lives in a Protestant neighborhood of Belfast, attempts to carry on a normal high school routine of sports, classes, and amateur theatrical productions despite the obsessive interest of a perverted biology teacher who persuades her to photograph and describe her bowel movements for him. Her father, meanwhile, a paramilitary hit man who has fled the country to avoid arrest, finds himself stuck in a Manhattan mental institution. Whether this is a mistake, a ruse to avoid deportation, or simply his natural habitat is not made much clearer than the rest of the story, which has little semblance of plot and proceeds along an uneven line from murkiness to utter incomprehensibility. To some extent, the lack of a clear storyline is part of the story in its own right, seemingly meant to express the aimlessness and deracination of the Protestant Loyalists of Ulster: ``Orphans of history with only their mad religion to give them any identity at all.'' But it also has the effect of keeping readers outside that hermetic world rather than bringing them into it. Rambling, incoherent, and gratuitously squalid. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His writing has inspired generations of writers and artists, from Pablo Neruda to Leonard Cohen and Patti Smith. <p>Born in Andalusia, Spain, in 1898, Lorca studied in Madrid as a young man and soon became prominent in artistic circles; in 1928 his book of <i>Gypsy Ballads</i> catapulted him to literary stardom. He escaped to New York for a year in 1929, where he found he was able to focus on his poetry and immerse himself in the thriving gay culture of Harlem; upon returning to republican Spain he became increasingly politicised, devoting himself to radical works of theatre that rebelled against the bourgeois status quo.</p> <p>Just after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he was murdered at Granada by Nationalist partisans.

Death was a serious chore for the killer, the victim, for the survivors. And for those who stood for the dead. Some went about the job devotedly, others carelessly.</p><p>And for some, murder was a labor of love.</p><p>When he left his Park Avenue condo for his regular morning stroll, Walter C. Pettibone was blissfully unaware he was in his last hours of life. He was a robust sixty and a canny businessman who'd increased his family's already considerable fortune through flowers and sentiment.</p><p>He was wealthy, healthy, and just over a year before had acquired a young, blonde wife who had the sexual appetite of a Doberman in heat and the brains of a cabbage.</p><p>His world, in Walter C. Pettibone's opinion, was just exactly so.</p><p>He had work he loved, two children from his first marriage who would one day take over the business he'd taken over from his own father. He maintained a reasonably friendly relationship with his ex, a fine, sensible woman, and his son and daughter were pleasant, intelligent individuals who brought him pride and satisfaction.</p><p>He had a grandson who was the apple of his eye.</p><p>In the summer of 2059, World of Flowers was a major intergalactic enterprise with florists, horticulturists, offices, and greenhouses both on and off planet.</p><p>Walter loved flowers. And not just for their profit margin. He loved the scents of them, the colors, the textures, the beauty of both foliage and blossom and the simple miracle of their existence.</p><p>Every morning he would visit a handful of florists, to check the stock, the arrangements, and just to sniff and chat and spend time among the flowers and the people who loved them.</p><p>Twice a week, he was up before dawn to attend the gardener's market downtown. There he would wander and enjoy, order or critique.</p><p>It was a routine that rarely varied over the course of a half-century, and one he never tired of.</p><p>Today, after an hour or so among the blooms, he'd go into the corporate offices. He'd spend more time there than usual in order to give his wife the time and space to finish preparations for his surprise birthday party.</p><p>It made him chuckle to think of it.</p><p>The sweetheart couldn't keep a secret if she stapled her lips together. He'd known about the party for weeks, and was looking forward to the evening with the glee of a child.</p><p>Naturally he would act surprised and had practiced stunned expressions in his mirror only that morning.</p><p>So Walter went through his daily routine with a smile at the corners of his mouth<b>&#x2014;</b>having no idea just how surprised he was going to be.</p><p></p><p>Eve doubted she'd ever felt better in her life. Rested, recharged, limber and loose, she prepared for her first day back on the job after a wonderfully undemanding two-</p><p>week vacation where the peskiest task facing her had been whether to eat or sleep.</p><p>One week at the villa in Mexico, the second on a private island. And in both spots there had been no lack of opportunities for sun, sex, and snoozing.</p><p>Roarke had been right again. They'd needed the time together. Away. They'd both needed a period of healing. And if the way she felt this morning was any indication, they'd done the job.</p><p>She stood in front of her closet, frowning at the jungle of clothes she'd acquired since her marriage. She didn't think her confusion was due to the fact that she'd spent most of the last fourteen days naked or near to it. Unless she was very much mistaken, the man had managed to sneak more clothes in on her.</p><p>She yanked out a long blue gown in some material that managed to sizzle and sparkle at the same time. ``Have I ever seen this before?''</p><p>``It's your closet.'' In the sitting area of their bedroom, Roarke scanned the stock reports on the wall screen while he enjoyed a second cup of coffee. But he glanced over. ``If you're planning to wear that today, the criminal element in the city's going to be very impressed.''</p><p>``There's more stuff in here than there was two weeks ago.''</p><p>``Really? I wonder how that happened.''</p><p>``You have to stop buying me clothes.''</p><p>He reached over to stroke Galahad, but the cat turned his nose in the air. He'd been sulking since their return the night before. ``Why?''</p><p>``Because it's embarrassing.'' She muttered it as she dived inside to find something reasonable to wear.</p><p>He only smiled at her, watching as she hunted up a sleeveless top and trousers to slip over that long, lean body he never quite stopped craving.</p><p>She'd tanned herself to a pale gold, and the sun had teased out blonde streaks in her short brown hair. She dressed quickly, economically, with the air of a woman who never thought about fashion. Which was why, he supposed, he could never resist heaping fashion on her.</p><p>She'd rested during their time away, he thought. He'd seen, hour by hour, day by day, the clouds of fatigue and worry lift away from her. There was a light in her whiskey-colored eyes now, a healthy glow in her narrow, fine-boned face.</p><p>And when she strapped on her weapon harness, there was a set to her mouth<b>&#x2014;</b>that wide and generous mouth<b>&#x2014;</b>that told him Lieutenant Eve Dallas was back. And ready to kick some ass.</p><p>``What is it about an armed woman that arouses me?''</p><p>She shot him a look, reached in the closet for a light jacket. ``Cut it out. I'm not going to be late my first day back because you've got some residual horniness.''</p><p>Oh yes, he thought, rising. She was back. ``Darling Eve.'' He managed, barely, not to wince. ``Not that jacket.''</p><p>``What?'' She paused in the act of shoving her arm in a sleeve. ``It's summer weight; it covers my weapon.''</p><p>``It's wrong with those trousers.'' He stepped to her closet, reached in, and plucked out another jacket of the same weight and material as the khaki trousers. ``This one is correct.''</p><p>``I'm not planning on doing a video shoot.'' But she changed it because it was easier than arguing.</p><p>``Here.'' After another dip into her closet, he came out with a pair of half-boots in rich chestnut brown leather.</p><p>``Where'd those come from?''</p><p>``The closet fairy.''</p><p>She frowned at the boots suspiciously, poked a finger into the toes. ``I don't need new boots. My old ones are all broken in.''</p><p>``That's a polite term for what they are. Try these.''</p><p>``Just gonna mess them up,'' she muttered, but sat on the arm of the sofa to pull them on. They slid onto her feet like butter. Which only made her eye him narrowly. He'd probably had them hand-tooled for her in one of his countless factories and they surely cost more than a New York murder cop made in two months. ``How about that. The closet fairy seems to know my shoe size.''</p><p>``An amazing fellow.''</p><p>``I suppose it's useless to tell him that a cop doesn't need expensive boots that were probably sewn together by some little Italian nun when she's clocking field time or hoofing it or knocking on doors.''</p><p>``He has a mind of his own.'' He skimmed a hand through her hair, tugged just enough to tip her face up to his. ``And he adores you.''</p><p>It still made her stomach flop<b>&#x2014;</b>hearing him say it, seeing his face as he did. She often wondered why she didn't just drown in those eyes of his, in all that wild, wicked blue.</p><p>``You're so damn pretty.'' She hadn't meant to say it aloud, nearly jolted at the sound of her voice. And she watched his grin flash, fast as fire across a face that belonged in a painting or carved into stone with its strong, sharp bones and seductive poet's mouth.</p><p>Young Irish God, she supposed it would be titled. For weren't gods seductive and ruthless and cloaked in their own power?</p><p>``I have to go.'' She got quickly to her feet, and he stood his ground so their bodies bumped. ``Roarke.''</p><p>``Yes, it's back to reality for both of us. But...'' His hands stroked down her sides, one long, possessive move that reminded her, all too clearly, just what those quick and clever fingers were capable of doing to her body. ``I think we can take a moment for you to kiss me good-bye.''</p><p>``You want me to kiss you good-bye?''</p><p>``I do, yes.'' There was a lilt of both amusement and Ireland in the tone that had her cocking her head.</p><p>``Sure.'' In a move as fast as his grin, she took handfuls of the black hair that nearly skimmed his shoulders, fisting, tugging, then crushing her mouth against his.</p><p>She felt his heart jump even as hers did. A leap of heat, of recognition, of unity. And on his sound of pleasure, she poured herself into the kiss, took them both fast and deep with a little war of tongues, a quick nip of teeth.</p><p>Then she jerked him back, stepped nimbly out of reach. ``See you, ace,'' she called out as she strode from the room.</p><p>``Have a safe day, Lieutenant.'' He blew out a long sigh, then sat back on the couch. ``Now,'' he said to the cat, ``what will it cost me for the two of us to be friends again?''</p><p></p><p>At Cop Central, Eve hopped on a glide to Homicide. And took a deep breath. Nothing against the cliffside drama of western Mexico or the balmy breezes of tropical islands, but she'd missed the air here: the smell of sweat, bad coffee, harsh cleansers, and above all, the fierce energies that formed from the clash of cop and criminal.</p><p>Her time away had only honed her senses for it<b>&#x2014;</b>the low roar of too many voices talking at once, the steady yet discordant beeps and buzzings of 'links and communicators, the rush of people all having something important to do somewhere.</p><p>She heard someone screaming obscenities so fast they tumbled together into one vicious stew of words that was music to her ears.</p><p>Motherfuckingassholecopbastards.</p><p>Welcome home, she thought happily.</p><p>The job had been her home, her life, her single defining purpose before Roarke. Now even with him, or maybe because she had him, it remained an essential part of who and what she was.</p><p>Once she'd been a victim<b>&#x2014;</b>helpless, used, and broken. Now, she was a warrior.</p><p>She swung into the detectives' bull pen, ready to fight whatever battle lay ahead.</p><p>Detective Baxter glanced up from his work, let out a low whistle. ``Whoa, Dallas. Hubba-hubba.''</p><p>``What?'' Baffled, she looked over her shoulder, then realized Baxter's leering grin was for her. ``You're a sick man, Baxter.

He pushed himself up, skirted around desks. ``Nice,'' he added, rubbing her lapel between his thumb and finger. ``You're a frigging fashion plate, Dallas. Put the rest of us to shame.''</p><p>``It's a jacket,'' she muttered, mortified. ``Cut it out.''</p><p>``Got yourself tanned, too. Would that be a full-body job?''</p><p>She bared her teeth in a fierce smile. ``Do I have to kick your ass?''</p><p>Enjoying himself, he wagged a finger. ``And what's that on your ears?'' As she reached up, confused, he blinked as if in surprise. ``Why, I believe those are called earrings. And they're real pretty, too.''</p><p>She'd forgotten she had them on. ``Did crime suddenly stop dead while I was gone so that you have time to stand around here critiquing my wardrobe?''</p><p>``I'm just dazzled, Lieutenant. Absolutely dazzled by this fashion presentation. New boots?''</p><p>``Bite me.'' She swung away on the sound of his laughter.</p><p>``And she is back!''

The New York Police and Security Department was peopled by a bunch of morons.</p><p>Jesus, she'd missed them.</p><p>She walked into her office, then just stood, one step over the threshold, goggling.</p><p>Her desk was clear. More, it was <i>clean</i>. In fact, the whole place was clean. Like someone had come along and sucked out all the dust and grime and then shined up what was left behind. Suspicious, she ran a thumb down the wall. Yes, that was definitely fresh paint.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, she continued into the room. It was a small space with one stingy window, a banged-up<b>&#x2014;</b>and now scrubbed<b>&#x2014;</b>desk, and a couple of chairs with bad springs. The file cabinet, also sparkling, had been cleared off. A green plant that appeared to be thriving stood on top of it.</p><p>With a little yelp of distress, she leaped to the file cabinet, yanked open a drawer.</p><p>``I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! Bastard hit me again.''</p><p>``Lieutenant?''</p><p>Snarling, Eve glanced back. Her aide stood in the doorway, as shipshape as the room in her starched summer blues.</p><p>``Goddamn sneaking candy thief found my cache.''</p><p>Peabody pursed her lips. ``You had candy in the file cabinet.'' She angled her head. ``Under M?''</p><p>``M for Mine, damn it.'' Annoyed, Eve slammed the drawer shut. ``I forgot to take it out before I left. What the hell happened in here, Peabody? I had to read the name on the door to be sure this was my office.''</p><p>``Since you were gone it seemed like a good time to have it cleaned and painted. It'd gotten pretty dingy in here.''</p><p>``I was used to it. Where's all my stuff?'' she demanded. ``I had some backlog, and some fives, and the ME's and a sweeper's reports on the Dunwood case should've come in while I was away.''</p><p>``I took care of it. I did the fives and caught up with the backlog, and filed the reports.'' She offered a smile that danced laughter into her dark eyes. ``I had some time on my hands.''</p><p>``You did all the paperwork?''</p><p>``Yes, sir.''</p><p>``And arranged to have my office overhauled?''</p><p>``I think there were multicelled organisms breeding in various corners. They're dead now.''</p><p>Slowly Eve slipped her hands into her pockets, rocked back on her heels. ``This wouldn't be your way of telling me that when I'm around I don't give you time to take care of daily business.''</p><p>``Absolutely not. Welcome back, Dallas. And I have to say that, wow, you look really terrific. Snappy outfit.''</p><p>Eve dropped into the chair at her desk. ``What the hell do I usually look like?''</p><p>``Is that a rhetorical question?''</p><p>Eve studied Peabody's face<b>&#x2014;</b>the square, sturdy looks topped with a dark bowl of hair. ``I'm trying to think if I missed your smart mouth. No,'' she decided. ``Not a bit.''</p><p>``Aw, sure you did. Great tan. I guess you spent a lot of time soaking up the sun and stuff.''</p><p>``I guess I did. Where'd you get yours?''</p><p>``My what?''</p><p>``The tan, Peabody. You go in for a flash?''</p><p>``No, I got it in Bimini.''</p><p>``Bimini, like the island?

As told by her vain but devoted dog, Sebastian, here is the story of the young princess's life&#x2015;from her childhood in Austria, to the elaborate preparations leading to her marriage to Louis XVI; from her unhappy rise to power in turbulent times, to the birth of her own children. Lynn Cullen's spirited text sheds light on a side of Marie Antoinette few have seen&#x2015;that of a vulnerable young girl thrust into a role much bigger than she could have imagined. Stunning illustrations by Amy Young capture the grandeur of life in 18th century Versailles and the touching intimacy of a child's lasting love for her pet.</p></p><p><p><b>Lynn Cullen</b> is the author of several picture books and novels. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Visit Lynn at www.lynncullen.com.</p><p><b>Amy Young</b> trained as a fine artist at Yale and received an MFA in painting from Indiana University. She then went on to earn a law degree from Harvard and worked as a lawyer for several years. She now devotes herself full time to writing and illustrating, and is the creator of the popular <i>Belinda</i> picture books. Visit Amy at www.amylyoung.com.</p>This picture-book account of Marie Antoinette, told from the perspective of her pug dog, Sebastien, highlights Antoinette's life from age 13 through her becoming queen of France and motherhood, with glimpses of eighteenth-century court life along the way. As Sebastien tells it, the queen's life leaves Antoinette unhappy, and with little time for Sebastien. But years later, after earning the affection of Antoinette's six-year-old daughter, Therese, Sebastien reminds Antoinette that happiness can be found through love, family, and, of course, dogs. The engaging, humorously vain pug delivers an animated narrative, which is whimsically illustrated in elegant, swirly, pastel-hued pictures, lavished with historical details. The dense prose and the focus on Antoinette as a teen and adult (Therese doesn't come in until the end of the story) suggest an older audience. Even so, the message is classic, and the royal pooch makes an enticing narrator, especially accessorized with period glamour. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It showcases four large projects, each with an accompanying small project similar in technique, and shows needle workers how to be creative with threads, alternative stitches and beads. Traditional techniques are explained but are extended with the use of bead embroidery, needle lace techniques, and stitches not normally used in crewel work. Many new needle lace and bead embroidery techniques are incorporated, and the book also explores weaving techniques used to create textures like twill and lace weaves, as well as patterns similar to tartan and houndstooth check. <br> Every project is clearly explained with step-by-step instructions and lots of photographs, and the completed embroideries are once again displayed in ways that are both decorative and functional in the home. Templates of the original designs complete this magnificent source for creative embroidery.</p><p>Hazel Blomkamp has dabbled with all the needlecrafts since childhood. When her children were babies she developed a passion for embroidery to break the tedium of life with toddlers, using it as her evening reward for having got though the day with her sanity intact. her children are now young adults and she still embroiders in front of the television every night. She has been designing for the past 18 years. Peferring to design projects which appear to be traditional, she pushes the boundaries by introducing other forms of needlecraft into traditional techniques, exploring further in everything that she does.

All patterns are printed at the rear of the book. There are seven sumptuous Jacobean panels to choose from, one transformed into a rectangular clock face and another mounted in a musical box.

Traditional Jacobean motifs are given a modern twist with contemporary colourways and a touch of sparkle with crystals and beads.

Nor a chore. Prayer is a way of life. Here&#39;s how you can move beyond rituals and discover new intimacy with Jesus. Henry and Norman Blackaby&#39;s thorough study of Jesus&#39; prayer life reveals astounding truths about God&#39;s intent for prayer. By the time you turn the last page of this 2006 National Day of Prayer book, your old notions will be replaced by the reality of Jesus&#39; example. You&#39;ll experience the power of heaven and earth being joined together as the King of all creation lays His heart over yours. Your will becomes aligned with His.

He earned his BD and ThM from Golden Gate Seminary and holds four honorary doctorate degrees. Dr. Blackaby has spent his life in ministry, serving as a church planter, pastor, and missionary. Today his primary message is an urgent call for spiritual leadership and revival across North America and around the world. Henry and his wife, Marilynn, have five children.With more than one million books in print, bestselling author Henry Blackaby's newest manual on praying efficaciously will no doubt win him continued fame as this text is also being touted as the official 2006 National Day of Prayer book. Blackaby teams up with his son Norman to present readers with a systematic prayer guide, which, though flawed, serves to both educate and challenge Christians' tired ideas of intercession. The Blackabys want to dispel old notions of ineffective prayer and unleash the power of God upon a sinful nation so as to redeem it from itself. Readers will better understand how vital intimate prayer is to a Christian's life and overall ministry, discern and receive God's agenda through some self-evaluation, and adopt a humility-based approach to prayer. Spread throughout this book are personal renderings from both father and son, recounting experiences of answered prayer. Perhaps the most helpful section is the chapter detailing how prayer protects believers from temptation and from falling away. However, most readers will expect more than this cursory overview of prayer techniques. Christians already know that God works through prayer, so to read a mere reiteration of this refrain without providing something more substantive to stimulate fervent prayer is disappointing. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every aspect of Stonehenge is re-considered in Aubrey Burl&#39;s new analysis. He explains for the first time how the outlying Heel Stone long predates Stonehenge itself, serving as a trackway marker in the prehistoric Harroway. He uncovers new evidence that the Welsh bluestones were brought to Stonehenge by glaciation rather than by man. And he reveals just how far the design of Stonehenge was influenced by Breton styles and by Breton cults of the dead. Meticulously research sets the record straight on the matter of Stonehenge&#39;s astronomical alignments. Although the existence of a sightline to the midsummer sunrise is well known, the alignment and the viewing-position are different from popular belief. And the existence of an earlier alignment to the moon and a later one to the midwinter sunset has been largely unrealized. One almost unexplained puzzle remains. The site of Stonehenge lies at the heart of a vast six-mile wide graveyard, but before it was built there appears to have been a mysterious gap two miles across on that site.Burl argues that earlier totem-pole style constructions served a ceremonial purpose for the living - to celebrate success in the hunt.</p><p>Aubrey Burl has published books on prehistoric stone circles, a history of the Albigensian Crusade, and two biographies - of an 18th-century pirate, Bartholomew Roberts, and of the medieval French poet, Francois Villon."Burl's authoritative book is indispensable."<br><br>"This masterly account of Britain's largest stone circle is so thorough, intelligent, and above all, wonderfully readable."</p><h2>Instinct: The Power to Unleash Your Inborn Drive</h2><p><b>Empower yourself and deepen your faith with the journaling exercises, leadership challenges, and personal growth tools in this interactive companion guide to T.

Driven by his conscience and protected by his fearsome skills, he enters a world where lovers become enemies and enemies become friends, where his only certainty is that somewhere, beyond a horizon smeared with the smoke of fires set by the rampaging English army, a terrible enemy awaits him. This enemy would harness the power of Chistendom&#39;s greatest relic: the Grail itself. Here, in the first book of a new series, the quest begins.

Barry, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of<i> The Great Influenza</i><br><br>The epic and controversial story of a major breakthrough in cell biology that led to the conquest of rubella and other devastating diseases. </b><br> &nbsp;<br>Until the late 1960s, tens of thousands of American children suffered crippling birth defects if their mothers had been exposed to rubella, popularly known as German measles, while pregnant; there was no vaccine and little understanding of how the disease devastated fetuses. In June 1962, a young biologist in Philadelphia, using tissue extracted from an aborted fetus from Sweden, produced safe, clean cells that allowed the creation of vaccines against rubella and other common childhood diseases. Two years later, in the midst of a devastating German measles epidemic, his colleague developed the vaccine that would one day wipe out homegrown rubella. The rubella vaccine and others made with those fetal cells have protected more than 150 million people in the United States, the vast majority of them preschoolers. The new cells and the method of making them also led to vaccines that have protected billions of people around the world from polio, rabies, chicken pox, measles, hepatitis A, shingles and adenovirus.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meredith Wadman&#x2019;s masterful account recovers not only the science of this urgent race, but also the political roadblocks that nearly stopped the scientists. She describes the terrible dilemmas of pregnant women exposed to German measles and recounts testing on infants, prisoners, orphans, and the intellectually disabled, which was common in the era. These events take place at the dawn of the battle over using human fetal tissue in research, during the arrival of big commerce in campus labs, and as huge changes take place in the laws and practices governing who &#x201c;owns&#x201d; research cells and the profits made from biological inventions. It is also the story of yet one more unrecognized woman whose cells have been used to save countless lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> With another frightening virus imperiling pregnant women on the rise today, no medical story could have more human drama, impact, or urgency&nbsp;today than <i>The Vaccine Race.</i></p><p><b>Meredith Wadman </b>has covered biomedical research politics from Washington for twenty years.

She arrived early, when her mother was about thirty-two weeks pregnant. The baby weighed 3.2 pounds and was noted to be blue, floppy, and not breathing. The only sign of life was her slow heartbeat. Nonetheless, she clung to life, and her seventeen-year-old mother named her.<br> &nbsp;<br> One month later the baby was still in the hospital, and a doctor leaning close with a stethoscope heard a harsh heart murmur. A chest X-ray showed that she had a massively enlarged heart because a hole in the muscular organ was preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Doctors also noticed that the baby was staring into space, not fixing her gaze on anything. An ophthalmologist was called in. It emerged that the baby had cataracts blinding both eyes. Later other signs indicated that she was profoundly deaf, although a formal hearing test was never conducted.<br> &nbsp;<br> In January 1965, after surgery attempting to repair one of the cataracts, the mother took her three-month-old daughter home. Nine days later the baby was back in the hospital with diarrhea. She remained in the hospital, where she suffered from recurring respiratory infections. She had trouble gaining weight, which is a common problem in infants with heart problems like hers. A psychologist who assessed her in July 1965, after a second heart defect was found, judged the nine-month-old to be the size of a two- or three-month-old infant and at about that stage of development; she couldn&#x2019;t sit up or grasp an object placed in her hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> The baby needed heart surgery if she was going to survive. Just before her first birthday, surgeons cut a seven-inch incision in her chest wall and repaired her heart. After the operation she remained in the hospital. The chronic respiratory infections continued. The baby was sixteen months old and weighed eleven pounds when she died of pneumonia at 3:30 a.m. on February 18, 1966. She had lived all but nine days of her brief life at Philadelphia General Hospital.<br> &nbsp;<br> The young mother had told the doctors something when she brought her daughter back to the hospital. When she was one month pregnant, she had had German measles, which is also known as rubella.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The early 1960s marked a coming of age for the study of viruses like the one that causes rubella&#x2014;tiny infectious agents that invade cells and hijack their machinery in order to reproduce themselves. Biologists, with new tools in hand, were racing to capture viruses in throat swabs or urine or even snippets of organs from infected people and to grow them in lab dishes. Isolating a virus in the lab made it possible to make a vaccine against it. And making antiviral vaccines promised huge inroads against common childhood diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella, along with less-common killers like hepatitis. The principle of vaccination is simple: if a person is injected with, or swallows, a tiny amount of a virus&#x2014;either a killed virus or a weakened live virus&#x2014;that person will develop antibodies against the virus. Then, if he or she is exposed in the future to the naturally occurring, disease-causing form of the virus, those antibodies will attack the invader and prevent it from causing disease.<br> &nbsp;<br> But if the concept is simple, making effective vaccines is anything but. In the early 1960s that reality was all too evident in recent tragedies. In 1942 as many as 330,000 U.S. servicemen were exposed to hepatitis B virus in a yellow fever vaccine that was contaminated with blood plasma from donors&#x2014;plasma that was used to stabilize the vaccine. It turned out that some of those donors carried hepatitis B. About 50,000 of the vaccinated servicemen came down with the dangerous liver disease and between 100 and 150 died.3 In 1955 a California-based company called Cutter Laboratories made polio vaccine with live, disease-causing virus in it, paralyzing 192 people, many of them children, and killing ten. Every senior U.S. government employee involved in overseeing the Cutter process lost his or her job&#x2014;right up through the director of the National Institutes of Health and the secretary of health, education, and welfare<i>.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Then in the summer of 1961, Americans learned that the monkey kidney cells used to make the famous Salk polio vaccine harbored a monkey virus called SV40. Tens of millions of American children had already received contaminated injections, and while the jury was still out on the tainted vaccine&#x2019;s&nbsp;long-term health consequences, the unknown risks were weighing on regulators in the United States and elsewhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was against this backdrop that, on a drizzly June morning in 1962, a young scientist went to work in his lab at the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, an elegant 1890s brownstone tucked in the heart of the University of Pennsylvania campus. Leonard Hayflick had just turned thirty-four years old. A serious, slight reserved man with close-cropped dark hair, Hayflick was a product of working-class Philadelphia and was hungry to make his name. He was in love with biology and was plenty smart, he had come to believe&#x2014;but that fact was far from appreciated. His boss, the famous polio-vaccine pioneer Hilary Koprowski, saw him as a mere technician, hired to serve up bottles of lab-grown cells to the institute&#x2019;s impressive cadre of biologists.<br> &nbsp;<br> This hadn&#x2019;t deterred the ambitious Hayflick. The previous year the junior scientist had published a paper challenging a major piece of scientific dogma: the belief that cells grown in a lab bottle, if properly nurtured, would multiply forever. His findings had been met with skepticism from some outstanding biologists. Let the critics carp, he thought. Time would prove that he was right&#x2014;that normal cells cultivated in the lab eventually died, just like human beings.<br> &nbsp;<br> On this drizzly day, however, Hayflick&#x2019;s mind was not on cell death but on cell birth. Today, he hoped, he was going to launch a group of normal human cells that would revolutionize vaccine making. He had been waiting months for this opportunity&#x2014;waiting for the arrival of the lungs that would be the source of these new cells. Cells were needed to make antiviral vaccines because outside of cells viruses can&#x2019;t multiply. And huge quantities of virus were needed to produce vaccines. Now, at last, the lungs were here in his bustling second-floor lab, two purplish things floating in clear pink fluid in a glass bottle. They&nbsp;had traveled all the way from Sweden packed on wet ice, courtesy of a Koprowski colleague who was a top virologist at the prestigious Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Several days earlier a woman living near Stockholm had had an abortion. Most Swedish physicians frowned upon the procedure, but it was legal, even for not-strictly-medical reasons. The woman was sixteen or seventeen weeks pregnant and had several children already. Her husband, she told her doctors, was an unsupportive alcoholic. The decision was clear. She sought out a sympathetic gynecologist, Eva Ernholm, one of the rare women in Swedish medical ranks, to perform the procedure.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the abortion the eight-inch-long, female fetus was wrapped in a sterile green cloth and delivered to a yellow brick outbuilding on the grounds of the National Biological Laboratory in northwest Stockholm. Here, in what they nicknamed the &#x201c;monkey house&#x201d; because it was also home to monkeys used in making polio vaccine, young PhD and medical students were occasionally called on to dissect out the lungs of aborted fetuses for shipping to the Wistar Institute. It wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant task, but when their boss, Sven Gard, the top virologist at the Karolinska Institute, asked them to do it, they obliged, slipping&nbsp;on head covers and changing from white wooden clogs to red or blue ones when they entered the sterile rooms. Other employees, working nearby in a grand building with a spiral staircase, were responsible for packing the lungs on ice and transporting them to Bromma Airport for the transatlantic flight that would eventually bring them to Philadelphia.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hayflick was convinced that compared with monkey kidney cells, which were often laden with lurking viruses, normal human cells would serve as cleaner, safer vehicles for making antiviral vaccines. And he knew that he was uniquely positioned to produce a long-lasting supply of such cells. He had spent the previous three years perfecting the procedure that would do it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hayflick took the bottle with the little lungs floating in it into a tiny room off his lab&#x2014;what passed for a &#x201c;sterile&#x201d; room in 1962. He picked up a pair of tweezers, dipped them in alcohol, and passed them through the flame of a Bunsen burner. He waited for them to cool and then, gently, one at a time, lifted the lungs out of the bottle and laid them on a petri dish. The underdeveloped organs were each no larger than his thumb above the knuckle. He assembled two scalpels, held the blades at right angles to each other, and began carefully slicing the lungs. He didn&#x2019;t stop until he had cut them into innumerable pieces, each smaller than a pinhead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hayflick nudged the minute pieces of lung into a wide-mouthed glass flask. The translucent pink fluid inside the flask looked innocent enough, but it was full of digestive enzymes from slaughtered pigs. These biological jackhammers broke up the &#x201c;mortar&#x201d; between the lung cells, freeing millions upon millions of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, he transferred the resulting cells into several flat-sided glass bottles and poured nutritious solution over them. He loaded the bottles onto a tray, and walked them into an incubation room beside his lab. Here the temperature was a cozy 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit. He laid the bottles on their sides on a wooden shelf and closed the door carefully behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cells began to divide.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hayflick already had a name for them: WI-38.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The WI-38 cells that Hayflick launched on that long-ago summer day were used to make vaccines that have been given to more than 300 million people&#x2014;half of them U.S. preschoolers. A copycat group of cells, developed using the method that Hayflick pioneered, has been used to make an additional 6 billion vaccines. Together these vaccines have protected people the world over from the gamut of&nbsp;viral illnesses: rubella, rabies, chicken pox, measles, polio, hepatitis A, shingles, and adenovirus&#x2014;a respiratory infection that flourishes where people live in close quarters. (Every U.S. military recruit&#x2014;more than 9 million of them since 1971&#x2014;is vaccinated with an adenovirus vaccine made using WI-38 cells.)<br> &nbsp;<br> In the United States the rubella vaccine made in WI-38 cells and still given to young children has wiped out homegrown rubella. That vaccine itself was developed at the Wistar, by Hayflick&#x2019;s colleague Stanley Plotkin, in the midst of a devastating rubella epidemic that swept the country in 1964 and 1965. That rubella outbreak damaged tens of thousands of American babies&#x2014;including the baby described above who lived most of her short life at Philadelphia General Hospital. This book will tell the story of that epidemic and of the race to develop a rubella vaccine that followed.<br> &nbsp;<br> How can it be that these WI-38 cells launched so long ago are still in use today? Partly because Hayflick made such a large initial stock of them: some eight hundred tiny, wine bottle&#x2013;shaped ampules that he froze in the summer of 1962. Partly because the cells, when frozen, stop dividing, but then gamely begin replicating again when they are thawed&#x2014;even after decades. And partly because of the power of exponential growth. Each petite glass vial that Hayflick froze contained between 1.5 million and 2 million cells. And the cells in those vials had, on average, the capacity to divide about forty more times. Early on, Hayflick did the math and determined that the newly derived cells covering the floor of just one of his small glass lab bottles, if allowed to replicate until they died, would produce 22 million tons of cells. He had created in those eight hundred vials a supply of cells that for practical purposes was almost<br> infinite.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so, in addition to their use in vaccine making, the WI-38 cells became the first normal, noncancerous cells available in virtually unlimited quantities to scientists probing the mysteries of cell biology. Because they were easily infected with so many viruses, they became important to disease detectives tracking viruses in the 1960s, before more sophisticated technology came along. Biologists still reach for WI-38 cells when they need a normal cell to compare against a cancerous one or to bombard with a potential new drug to see if it&#x2019;s toxic. The cells are also a workhorse of aging research, because they so reliably age and then die in lab dishes. They are held in such high regard by scientific historians that original ampules of WI-38, and of polio vaccine made using it, are part of the collection of the National Museum of American History.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the 1960s and 1970s the cells became the object of a bitter, epochal feud between Hayflick and the U.S. government, first over whether they were safe for vaccine making and then over who owned them. Hayflick&#x2019;s preternaturally proprietary feelings for the cells&#x2014;he once described them as &#x201c;like my children&#x201d;&#x2014;led him to defiantly decamp from the Wistar to a new job three thousand miles away at Stanford University with the entire stock of WI-38 cells. His escape infuriated the Wistar&#x2019;s director, Koprowski, who had his own money-making designs on the cells.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hayflick&#x2019;s flight with the cells would eventually make him the target of a career-derailing investigation by the National Institutes of Health, which had funded his work deriving WI-38. 8 Then, just as the tug-of-war over ownership of the WI-38 cells peaked in the second half of the 1970s, profound changes occurred in attitudes and laws governing who could make money from biological inventions. In the space of very few years, biologists went from being expected to work for their salaries and the greater good&#x2014;and nothing more&#x2014;to being encouraged by their universities and the government to commercialize their inventions for the benefit of their institutions, the U.S. economy&#x2014;and themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although the WI-38 cells were launched long before these changes took place&#x2014;and eighteen years before the Supreme Court decreed that a living entity like a WI-38 cell could be patented&#x2014;that is not to say that money has not been made from them. The huge drug company Merck in particular has made&nbsp;billions of dollars by using the WI-38 cells to make the rubella vaccine that is part of the vaccine schedule for U.S. babies and preschoolers&#x2014;ensuring more than seven million injections each year, not including those in more than forty other countries where the Merck vaccines is sold. The Wistar Institute too until the late 1980s enjoyed a handsome royalty stream from vaccines made by its scientists using the WI-38 cells&#x2014;including a much-i...</p><h2>The Secret of Santa Vittoria</h2><p>5TH PRINTING THE BOOK IS REALLY VERY GOOD. tHE jACKET IS ALL TORN</p><p>ROBERT CRICHTON (1925-1993) an American novelist, served in the infantry during World War II and was wounded in 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge. After the war he attended Harvard University on the GI Bill. His bestseller, <i>The Great Imposter</i>, was adapted into a successful film. His novel <i>The Secret of Santa Vittoria</i> was on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list for over 50 weeks, became an international bestseller, and was adapted into a Golden Globe winning film of the same name in 1969.The Italian hill town of Santa Vittoria cannot be said to have been untouched by the twentieth century, but it has made its own terms. It functions at a pace, and in a perspective, that reduces the German occupation during WWII to a temporary inconvenience. This is comedy in the classical manner, with echoes all the way back to Don Quixote. For a leisurely novel about a slow-paced community, Christopher Hurt is perhaps a bit too brisk and businesslike. But he&#39;s sympathetic to his material and projects an appreciation of its subtleties. His character voices aren&#39;t masterful, but competent and consistent. All in all, he succeeds in laying the novel before the listener to be enjoyed without effort or distraction. J.N.

The house is unassuming: half-timbered, with white paint peeling gently on the western side and clematis scrambling up the plaster. The chimney pots are steaming, and you know, just by looking, that there&#x2019;s something tasty simmering on the stove top beneath. It&#x2019;s something in the way the vegetable patch has been laid out, just so, at the back of the house, the proud gleam of the leadlight windows, the careful patching of the roofing tiles.<br> <br>A rustic fence hems the house, and a wooden gate separates the tame garden from the meadows on either side, the copse beyond. Through the knotted trees a stream trickles lightly over stones, flitting between sunlight and shadow as it has done for centuries, but it can&#x2019;t be heard from here. It&#x2019;s too far away. The house is quite alone, sitting at the end of a long, dusty driveway, invisible from the country lane whose name it shares.<br> <br>Apart from an occasional breeze, all is still, all is quiet. A pair of white hula hoops, last year&#x2019;s craze, stand propped against the wisteria arch. A teddy bear with an eye patch and a look of dignified tolerance keeps watch from his vantage point in the peg basket of a green laundry trolley. A wheelbarrow loaded with pots waits patiently by the shed.<br> <br>Despite its stillness, perhaps because of it, the whole scene has an expectant, charged feeling, like a theater stage in the moments before the actors walk out from the wings. When every possibility stretches ahead and fate has not yet been sealed by circumstance, and then&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Laurel!&#x201d; A child&#x2019;s impatient voice, some distance off. &#x201c;Laurel, where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s as if a spell has been broken. The house lights dim; the curtain lifts.<br> <br>A clutch of hens appears from nowhere to peck between the bricks of the garden path, a jay drags his shadow across the garden, a tractor in the nearby meadow putters to life. And high above it all, lying on her back on the floor of a wooden tree house, a girl of sixteen pushes the lemon Spangle she&#x2019;s been sucking hard against the roof of her mouth and sighs.<br> <br><br> <br>It was cruel, she supposed, just to let them keep hunting for her, but with the heat wave and the secret she was nursing, the effort of games&#x2014;childish games at that&#x2014;was just too much to muster. Besides, it was all part of the challenge, and as Daddy was always saying, fair was fair and they&#x2019;d never learn if they didn&#x2019;t try. It wasn&#x2019;t Laurel&#x2019;s fault she was better at finding hiding places. They were younger than her, it was true, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if they were babies.<br> <br>And anyway, she didn&#x2019;t particularly want to be found. Not today. Not now. All she wanted to do was lie here and let the thin cotton of her dress flutter against her bare legs, while thoughts of him filled her mind.<br> <br>Billy.<br> <br>She closed her eyes, and his name sketched itself with cursive flair across the blackened lids. Neon, hot-pink neon. Her skin prickled, and she flipped the Spangle so its hollow center balanced on the tip of her tongue.<br> <br>Billy Baxter.<br> <br>The way he stared at her over the top of his black sunglasses, the jagged lopsided smile, his dark teddy-boy hair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>It had been instant, just as she&#x2019;d known real love would be. She and Shirley had stepped off the bus five Saturdays ago to find Billy and his friends smoking cigarettes on the dance-hall steps. Their eyes had met, and Laurel had thanked God she&#x2019;d decided a weekend&#x2019;s pay was fair exchange for a new pair of nylons.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Laurel.&#x201d; This was Iris, voice sagging with the day&#x2019;s heat. &#x201c;Play fair, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Laurel closed her eyes tighter.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d danced each dance together. The band had skiffled faster, her hair had loosened from the French roll she&#x2019;d copied carefully from the cover of Bunty, her feet had ached, but still she&#x2019;d kept on dancing. Not until Shirley, miffed at having been ignored, arrived aunt-like by her side and said the last bus home was leaving if Laurel cared to make her curfew (she, Shirley, was sure she didn&#x2019;t mind either way) had she finally stopped. And then, as Shirley tapped her foot and Laurel said a flushed good-bye, Billy had grabbed her hand and pulled her towards him, and something deep inside of Laurel had known with blinding clarity that this moment, this beautiful, starry moment, had been waiting for her all her life&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, suit yourself.&#x201d; Iris&#x2019;s tone was clipped now, cross. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t blame me when there&#x2019;s no birthday cake left.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sun had slipped past noon, and a slice of heat fell through the tree-house window, firing Laurel&#x2019;s inner eyelids cherry cola. She sat up but made no further move to leave her hiding spot. It was a decent threat&#x2014;Laurel&#x2019;s weakness for her mother&#x2019;s Victoria sponge was legendary&#x2014;but an idle one. Laurel knew very well that the cake knife lay forgotten on the kitchen table, missed amid the earlier chaos as the family gathered picnic baskets, rugs, fizzy lemonade, swimming towels, and the new transistor, and burst, stream-bound, from the house. She knew because when she&#x2019;d doubled back under the guise of hide-and-seek and sneaked inside the cool, dim house to fetch the package, she&#x2019;d seen the knife sitting by the fruit bowl, red bow tied around its handle.<br> <br>The knife was a tradition&#x2014;it had cut every birthday cake, every Christmas cake, every Somebody-Needs-Cheering-Up cake in the Nicolson family&#x2019;s history&#x2014;and their mother was a stickler for tradition. Ergo, until someone was dispatched to retrieve the knife, Laurel knew she was free. And why not? In a household like theirs, where quiet minutes were rarer than hen&#x2019;s teeth, where someone was always coming through one door or slamming another, to squander privacy was akin to sacrilege.<br> <br>Today, especially, she needed time to herself.<br> <br>The package had arrived for Laurel with last Thursday&#x2019;s post, and in a stroke of good fortune Rose had been the one to meet the postman, not Iris or Daphne or&#x2014;God help her&#x2014;Ma. Laurel had known immediately who it was from. Her cheeks had burned crimson, but she&#x2019;d managed somehow to stutter words about Shirley and a band and an EP she was borrowing. The effort of obfuscation was lost on Rose, whose attention, unreliable at best, had already shifted to a butterfly resting on the fence post.<br> <br>Later that evening, when they were piled in front of the television watching Juke Box Jury, and Iris and Daphne were debating the comparative merits of Cliff Richard and Adam Faith, and their father was bemoaning the latter&#x2019;s false American accent and the broader wastage of the entire British Empire, Laurel had slipped away. She&#x2019;d fastened the bathroom lock and slid to the floor, back pressed firm against the door.<br> <br>Fingers trembling, she&#x2019;d torn the end of the package.<br> <br>A small book wrapped in tissue had dropped into her lap. She&#x2019;d read its title through the paper&#x2014;The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter&#x2014;and a thrill had shot along her spine. Laurel had been unable to keep from squealing.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been sleeping with it inside her pillowcase ever since. Not the most comfortable arrangement, but she liked to keep it close. She needed to keep it close. It was important.<br> <br>There were moments, Laurel solemnly believed, in which a person reached a crossroads, when something happened, out of the blue, to change the course of life&#x2019;s events. The premiere of Pinter&#x2019;s play had been just such a moment. She&#x2019;d read about it in the newspaper, and felt an inexplicable urge to attend. She&#x2019;d told her parents she was visiting Shirley and sworn Shirley to deepest secrecy, and then caught the bus into Cambridge.<br> <br>It had been her first trip anywhere alone, and as she sat in the darkened Arts Theatre watching Stanley&#x2019;s birthday party descend into nightmare, she&#x2019;d experienced an elevation of spirits the likes of which she&#x2019;d never felt before. It was the sort of revelation the flush-faced Misses Buxton seemed to enjoy at church each Sunday morning, and while Laurel suspected their enthusiasm had more to do with the new young rector than the word of God, sitting on the edge of her cheap seat as the lifeblood of the onstage drama reached inside her chest and plugged into her own, she&#x2019;d felt her face heat blissfully, and she&#x2019;d known. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what exactly, but she&#x2019;d known it absolutely: there was more to life, and it was waiting for her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d nursed her secret to herself, not entirely sure what to do with it, not remotely sure how to go about explaining it to someone else, until the other evening, with his arm around her and her cheek pressed firmly against his leather jacket, she&#x2019;d confessed it all to Billy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Laurel took his letter from inside the book and read it again. It was brief, saying only that he&#x2019;d be waiting for her with his motorcycle at the end of the lane on Saturday afternoon at two thirty&#x2014;there was this little place he wanted to show her, his favorite spot along the coast.<br> <br>Laurel checked her wristwatch. Less than two hours to go.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d nodded when she told him about the performance of The Birthday Party and how it made her feel; he&#x2019;d spoken about London and theater and the bands he&#x2019;d seen in nameless nightclubs, and Laurel had glimpsed gleaming possibilities. And then he&#x2019;d kissed her, her first proper kiss, and the electric bulb inside her head had exploded so that everything burned white.<br> <br>She shifted to where Daphne had propped the little hand mirror from her vanity set, and stared at herself, comparing the black flicks she&#x2019;d drawn with painstaking care at the corner of each eye. Satisfied they were even, she smoothed her fringe and tried to quell the dull, sick-making sense that she&#x2019;d forgotten something important. She&#x2019;d remembered a beach towel; she wore her swimsuit already beneath her dress; she&#x2019;d told her parents that Mrs. Hodgkins needed her for some extra hours in the salon, sweeping and cleaning.<br> <br>Laurel turned from the mirror and nibbled a snag of fingernail. It wasn&#x2019;t in her nature to sneak about, not really; she was a good girl, everybody said so&#x2014;her teachers, the mothers of friends, Mrs. Hodgkins&#x2014;but what choice did she have? How could she ever explain it to her mother and father?<br> <br>She knew quite certainly that her parents had never felt love, no matter the stories they liked to tell about the way they met. Oh, they loved each other well enough, but it was a safe, old-person&#x2019;s love, the sort expressed in shoulder rubs and endless cups of tea. No&#x2014;Laurel sighed heatedly. It was safe to say that neither had ever known the other sort of love, the sort with fireworks and racing hearts and physical&#x2014;she blushed&#x2014;desires.<br> <br>A warm gust brought with it the distant sound of her mother&#x2019;s laughter, and the awareness, however vague, that she stood at a precipice in her life made Laurel fond. Dear Ma. It wasn&#x2019;t her fault her youth had been wasted on the war. That she&#x2019;d been practically twenty-five when she met and married Daddy; that she still trotted out her paper-boat-making skills when any of them needed cheering up; that the highlight of her summer had been winning the village gardening club prize and having her picture in the paper. (Not just the local paper, either&#x2014;the article had been syndicated in the London press, in a big special about regional happenings. Shirley&#x2019;s barrister father had taken great pleasure in trimming it out of his newspaper and bringing it round to show them.) Ma had played at embarrassment and protested when Daddy stuck the clipping on the new refrigerator, but only halfheartedly, and she hadn&#x2019;t taken it down. No, she was proud of her extra-long runner beans, really proud, and that was just the sort of thing that Laurel meant. She spat out a fine shard of fingernail. In some indescribable way it seemed kinder to deceive a person who took pride in runner beans than it was to force her to accept the fact that the world had changed.<br> <br>Laurel hadn&#x2019;t much experience with deceit. They were a close family&#x2014;all of her friends remarked upon it. To her face and, she knew, behind her back. As far as outsiders were concerned, the Nicolsons had committed the deeply suspicious sin of seeming genuinely to like one another. But lately things had been different. Though Laurel went through all the usual motions, she&#x2019;d been aware of a strange new distance. She frowned slightly as the summer breeze dragged strands of hair across her cheek. At night, when they sat around the dinner table and her father made his sweet, unfunny jokes and they all laughed anyway, she felt as if she were on the outside looking in, as if the others were on a train carriage, sharing the same old family rhythms, and she alone stood at the station watching as they pulled away.<br> <br>Except that it was she who would be leaving them, and soon. She&#x2019;d done her research: the Central School of Speech and Drama was where she needed to go. What, she wondered, would her parents say when she told them she wanted to leave? Neither of them was particularly worldly&#x2014;her mother hadn&#x2019;t even been as far as London since Laurel was born&#x2014;and the mere suggestion that their eldest daughter was considering a move there, let alone a shadowy existence in the theater, was likely to send them into a state of apoplexy.<br> <br>Below her, the washing shrugged wetly on the line. A leg of the denim jeans Grandma Nicolson hated so much (&#x201c;You look cheap, Laurel&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing worse than a girl who throws herself around&#x201d;) flapped against the other, frightening the one-winged hen into squawking and turning circles. Laurel slid her white-rimmed sunglasses onto her nose and slumped against the tree-house wall.<br> <br>The problem was the war. It had been over for sixteen years&#x2014;all her life&#x2014;and the world had moved on. Everything was different now; gas masks, uniforms, ration cards, and all the rest of it belonged only in the big old khaki trunk her father kept in the attic. Sadly, though, some people didn&#x2019;t seem to realize it&#x2014;namely, the entire population over the age of twenty-five.<br> <br>Billy said she wasn&#x2019;t ever going to find the words to make them understand. He said it was called the &#x201c;generation gap&#x201d; and that trying to explain herself was pointless, that it was like it said in the Alan Sillitoe book he carried everywhere in his pocket, adults weren&#x2019;t supposed to understand their children and you were doing something wrong if they did.<br> <br>A habitual streak in Laurel&#x2014;the good girl, loyal to her parents&#x2014;had leaped to disagree with him, but she hadn&#x2019;t. Her thoughts had fallen instead to the evenings lately when she managed to creep away from her sisters, when she stepped out into the balmy dusk, transistor radio tucked beneath her blouse, and climbed with a racing heart into the tree house. There, alone, she&#x2019;d hurry the tuning dial to Radio Luxembourg and lie back in the dark, letting the music surround her. And as it seeped into the still country air, blanketing the ancient landscape with the newest songs, Laurel&#x2019;s skin would prickle with the sublime intoxication of knowing herself to be part of something bigger: a worldwide conspiracy, a secret group. A new generation of people, all listening at the very same moment, who understood that life, the world, the future, were out there waiting for them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Laurel opened her eyes and the memory fled. Its warmth lingered, though, and with a satisfied stretch she followed the path of a rook casting across a graze of cloud. Fly, little b...</p><h2>The Orchard</h2><p>On a warm evening, twelve teenagers decide to have a picnic in the Orchard, a fateful picnic that leads to seemingly accidental death, a suicide, a mutilation murder, and other horrifying events</p><p></p><h2>9-11</h2><p>In 9-11, Noam Chomsky comments on the September 11th attacks, the new war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden, U.S. involvement with Afghanistan, media control, and the long-term implications of America&#39;s military attacks abroad. Informed by his deep understanding of the gravity of these issues and the global stakes, 9-11 demonstrates Chomsky&#39;s impeccable knowledge of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and South Asia, and sheds light on the rapidly shifting balance of world power. Speaking out against escalating violence, Chomsky critically examines the United States&#39; own foreign policy record and considers what international institutions might be employed against underground networks and national states accused of terrorism. 9-11&#39;s analysis still stands as a measure of how well the media is able to serve its role of informing the citizenry, so crucial to our democracy in times of war.</p><p>NOAM CHOMSKY is known throughout the world for his political and philosophical writings as well as for his groundbreaking linguistics work. He has taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1955 and remains one of America&#39;s most uncompromising voices of dissent.MIT-based Chomsky revolutionized linguistics in the late Fifties, but for nearly as long he has been better known as an energetic and constructive debunker of American establishment politics and behavior. However, the current Chomsky contributes nothing to the legacy he established decades ago. These two most recent productions do not reveal systematic efforts to sustain or develop any aspect of his prolifically expressed critique; indeed, they are not so much authored as collaged, with Chomsky's sanction, from talks, after-talk Q&amp;As, and interviews with generally converted interlocutors. Understanding Power draws mainly on vintage utterances from the Nineties, and its most penetrating passage takes on, of all pressing matters, literary theory. Chomsky, who is relentless in condemning the media as incapable of any function other than converting the masses to elite desires, just as relentlessly samples mainstream reporting sources for instances of corporate and government ill doings. In trying to illustrate that he is not a crude conspiracy theorist, he conveys the opposite impression. The shorter 9-11 could not have been planned, of course, though it mostly consists of interviews conducted while the calendar still read September, suggesting both the urgency Chomsky felt to get his perspective on the record and his utter disinclination to reexamine any of his cemented opinions about world affairs. Chomsky condemns the attacks specifically and then suggests that the deaths are entirely the responsibility of capitalist globalization, which nonetheless he asserts is irrelevant to the September 11 actors. However, consistency is even less a priority for Chomsky than humility. Apparently, Chomsky believes that he has discovered the concept of blowback, not to mention imbalance in coverage of the perpetual Israeli-Palestinian murder-and-misery fetish. For him, a direct line runs from Reagan's mining of Nicaragua's harbors to the flying of commercial airliners into buildings. 9-11 is a worthwhile purchase for public libraries intent on demonstrating (or risking) balance; Understanding Power is not half as useful as Chomsky's earlier, authentic innovations in political literature, especially Manufacturing Consent (coauthored with Edward Herman). Libraries truly wishing to ensure representation of the most lucid nonconventional opinion should first check that their subscriptions to the Nation a proud carrier of Chomsky for 40 years are current.

Like when I saw the snow?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why not to talk about it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister puts her arm around me and rocks us sideways, left and right, as we sit on the schoolroom bench. The warmth and the hug and the rocking ease my mind and I rock back against Sallo, bumping her a little. But I can&#x2019;t keep from remembering what I saw, the dreadful excitement of it, and pretty soon I burst out, &#x201c;But I ought to tell them! It was an invasion! They could warn the soldiers to be ready!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And they&#x2019;d say&#x2014;when?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That stumps me. &#x201c;Well, just ready.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But what if it doesn&#x2019;t happen for a long time? They&#x2019;d be angry at you for giving a false alarm. And then if an army did invade the city, they&#x2019;d want to know how you knew.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d tell them I remembered it!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Sallo says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever tell them about remembering the way you do. They&#x2019;ll say you have a power. And they don&#x2019;t like people to have powers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t! Just sometimes I remember things that are going to happen!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I know. But Gavir, listen, truly, you mustn&#x2019;t talk about it to anybody. Not anybody but me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sallo says my name in her soft voice, when she says, &#x201c;Listen, truly,&#x201d; I do truly listen to her. Even though I argue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not even Tib?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not even Tib.&#x201d; Her round, brown face and dark eyes are quiet and serious.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Because only you and I are Marsh people.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So was Gammy!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It was Gammy that told me what I&#x2019;m telling you. That Marsh people have powers, and the city people are afraid of them. So we never talk about anything we can do that they can&#x2019;t. It would be dangerous. Really dangerous. Promise, Gav.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She puts up her hand, palm out. I fit my grubby paw against it to make the vow. &#x201c;I promise,&#x201d; I say as she says, &#x201c;I hear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her other hand she&#x2019;s holding the little Ennu-M� she wears on a cord around her neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kisses the top of my head and then bumps me so hard I nearly fall off the end of the bench. But I won&#x2019;t laugh; I&#x2019;m so full of what I remembered, it was so awful and so frightening, I want to talk about it, to tell everybody, to say, &#x201c;Look out, look out! Soldiers are coming, enemies, with a green flag, setting the city on fire!&#x201d; I sit swinging my legs, sullen and mournful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell me about it again,&#x201d; Sallo says. &#x201c;Tell all the bits you left out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s what I need. And I tell her again my memory of the soldiers coming up the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes what I remember has a secret feeling about it, as if it belongs to me, like a gift that I can keep and take out and look at when I&#x2019;m by myself, like the eagle feather Yaven-d� gave me. The first thing I ever remembered, the place with the reeds and the water, is like that. I&#x2019;ve never told anybody about it, not even Sallo. There&#x2019;s nothing to tell; just the silvery-blue water, and reeds in the wind, and sunlight, and a blue hill way off. Lately I have a new remembering: the man in the high room in shadows who turns around and says my name. I haven&#x2019;t told anybody that. I don&#x2019;t need to.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there&#x2019;s the other kind of remembering, or seeing, or whatever it is, like when I remembered seeing the Father come home from Pagadi, and his horse was lame; only he hadn&#x2019;t come home yet and didn&#x2019;t until next summer, and then he came just as I remembered, on the lame horse. And once I remembered all the streets of the city turning white, and the roofs turning white, and the air full of tiny white birds all whirling and flying downward. I wanted to tell everybody about that, it was so amazing, and I did. Most of them didn&#x2019;t listen. I was only four or five then. But it snowed, later that winter. Everybody ran outside to see the snowfall, a thing that happens in Etra maybe once in a hundred years, so that we children didn&#x2019;t even know what it was called. Gammy asked me, &#x201c;Is this what you saw? Was it like this?&#x201d; And I told her and all of them it was just what I&#x2019;d seen, and she and Tib and Sallo believed me. That must have been when Gammy told Sallo what Sallo had just told me, not to talk about things I remembered that way. Gammy was old and sick then, and she died in the spring after the snowfall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then I&#x2019;d only had the secret rememberings, until this morning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was by myself early in the morning, sweeping the hall outside the nursery rooms, when I began remembering. At first I just remembered looking down a city street and seeing fire leap up from a house roof and hearing shouts. The shouts got louder, and I recognised Long Street, running north from the square behind the Forefathers&#x2019; Shrine. At the far end of the street smoke was billowing out in big greasy clouds with red flames inside them. People were running past me, all over the square, women and men, most of them running towards the Senate Square, shouting and calling out, but city guards ran by in the other direction with their swords drawn. Then I could see soldiers at the far end of Long Street under a green banner; they had long lances, and the ones on horseback had swords. The guards met with them, and there was deep shouting, and ringing and clashing like a smithy, and the whole crowd of men, a great writhing knot of armor and helmets and bare arms and swords, came closer and closer. A horse broke from it, galloping up the street straight at me, riderless, lathered with white sweat streaked red, blood running from where its eye should be. The horse was screaming. I dodged back from it. And then I was in the hall with a broom in my hand, remembering it. I was still terrified. It was so clear I couldn&#x2019;t forget it at all. I kept seeing it again, and seeing more. I had to tell somebody.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when Sallo and I went to get the schoolroom ready and were there alone, I told her. And now I told her all over again, and telling it made me remember it again, and I could see and tell it better. Sallo listened intently and shivered when I described the horse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What kind of helmets did they have?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at the memory of the men fighting in the street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Black, mostly. One of them had a black crest, like a horse&#x2019;s tail.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Do you think they were from Osc?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have those long wood shields like the Oscan captives in the parade. It was like all their armor was metal&#x2014;bronze or iron&#x2014;it made this huge clanging sound when they were fighting with the guards with swords. I think they came from Morva.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who came from Morva, Gav?&#x201d; said a pleasant voice behind us, and we both jumped like puppets on strings. It was Yaven. Intent on my story, neither of us had heard him, and we had no idea how long he&#x2019;d been listening. We reverenced him quickly and Sallo said, &#x201c;Gav was telling me one of his stories, Yaven-d�.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds like a good one,&#x201d; Yaven said. &#x201c;Troops from Morva would march with a black-and-white banner, though.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who has green?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Casicar.&#x201d; He sat down on the front bench, stretching out his long legs. Yaven Altanter Arca was seventeen, the eldest son of the Father of our House. He was an officer in training of the Etran army, and away on duty much of the time now, but when he was home he came to the schoolroom for lessons just as he used to. We loved having him there because, being grown up, he made us all feel grown up, and because he was always good-natured, and because he knew how to get Everra, our teacher, to let us read stories and poems instead of doing grammar and logic exercises.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls were coming in now, and Torm ran in with Tib and Hoby from the ball court, sweating, and finally Everra entered, tall and grave in his grey robe. We all reverenced the teacher and sat down on the benches. There were eleven of us, four children of the Family and seven children of the House.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yaven and Torm were the sons of the Arca Family, Astano was the daughter, and Sotur was their cousin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the house slaves, Tib and Hoby were boys of twelve and thirteen, I was eleven, and Ris and my sister Sallo were thirteen. Oco and her little brother Miv were much younger, just learning their letters.</p> <p>Copyright � 2007 by Ursula K. Le Guin</p> <p>All rights reserved.

This highly influential volume, first published in 1890, contains Mahan&#39;s analysis and discussions of the factors leading to Britain&#39;s naval domination in the eighteenth century, with strategic and tactical recommendations based on these factors.<p>"Captain Mahan has written distinctively the best and most important, and also by far the most interesting, book on naval history which has been produced on either side of the water for many a long year." <br>--Atlantic Monthly <br>October 1890</p><p>First published over a century ago, this classic text on the history and tactics of naval warfare had a profound effect on the training of officers and the deployment of naval resources around the globe. Many of the world's great military strategists since 1890 have avidly read this book, including both Franklin Delano and Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and a host of admirals, chancellors, prime ministers, kings, and other presidents. It continues to be a primary reference for naval students and historians.</p><p>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783 presents the argument that, despite great changes and scientific advances in naval weaponry, certain principles of naval strategy remain constant. Beginning in the time of Alexander the Great, those nations with strong commercial and military command of the seas were the nations of greatest strength, wealth, and power. Though the determinants of military supremacy and the global balance of power have changed due to tremendous advances in technology, the principles and strategies discussed in the book remain creditable. The extensive presentation of the history of high-seas navigation alone makes this book an invaluable resource, as it has been credited with stimulating the growth of modern navies in leading countries of the world.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) served in the Civil War and twice served as the president of the United States Naval War College, beginning shortly after the college was founded. Mahan became known as one of the leading spokesmen for the age of American imperialism. In addition to his books on the history of naval warfare, he wrote biographies of David Farragut and Horatio Nelson.</p></p><h2>Horses and Other Animals in Motion: 45 Classic Photographic Sequences (Dover Anatomy for Artists)</h2><p>In 1887 the University of Pennsylvania first published <i>Animal Locomotion</i> by pioneering photographer Eadweard Muybridge, an extraordinary compilation of high-speed sequential photographs that has never been superseded as the most detailed, complete, and useful visual analysis of living movement ever captured on film. Dover has selected the best of Muybridge's animal photographs for this inexpensive paperbound edition. It brings an unsurpassed pictorial reference within reach of artists, photographers, animators, zoologists, and anyone interested in the precise dynamics of how an animal moves.<br>Taken at speeds up to 1/2,000 of a second, true action images show horses and other animals photographed in typical actions against ruled backgrounds. Most sequences include shots from two angles, many in foreshortened views. Horses are shown walking, trotting, cantering, galloping, pulling a weight, drawing a vehicle, and with riders bareback and in the saddle.<br>Dozens of other stopped-action photographs capture split-second motions of the ox, sow, goat, dog, cat, antelope, lion, camel, elk, baboon, elephant, ostrich, pigeon, cockatoo, and other animals. You&#x2019;ll see precisely how a cat runs; how an elk trots; the way a lion sets its paw down, how an ostrich&#x2019;s head bobs; exactly how a dog jumps a hurdle; and many other vignettes of animals on the move.<br>Most important, Muybridge&#x2019;s photographs capture many movements too fast for the human eye to catch. Here are the rapid, often minute adjustments of bone and muscle involved in leg coordination, head movements, shifts of gravity centers, and other aspects of living motion.<br>Now you can study these and other details in 45 classic sequences from Muybridge&#x2019;s landmark of early photography, reproduced directly from a rare original edition of <i>Animal Locomotion.</i> Best of all, this inexpensive Dover edition, unprecedented in publishing, makes a rich selection of the photographs widely available at a reasonable price.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Grouchy Ladybug (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

From political intrigue within the Senate to bloody battlefields on exotic worlds, the war has left its mark on the bystanders as well as the combatants, and the events in this wide-ranging volume reveal the extent of the damage. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker battle for survival, Senator Bail Organa struggles to preserve freedom within the Republic, and Master Yoda strives to prevent an old friend from plunging a system into war in four exciting stories from the Clone Wars!</p><p>Volume 5, <i>The Best Blades</i>, is one of the best installments of the <i>Clone Wars</i> graphic novel series. The action takes place on multiple fronts. Senator Bail Organa tries to keep Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from acquiring still more power, while on Merson, a self-described "ordinary Jedi," Ron-Har Kim from Naboo, discovers the folly of having entered into a trust with Palpatine. On the more positive side for the Republic, a hero thought lost makes a return in "Hate and Fear," which also reveals the back story of the vicious Asajj Ventress. But in the title story, Yoda's trip to Thustra severely tests his resolve for nonviolent resolution and his belief that "the best blades are kept in their sheaths." The dynamic stories originally appeared in <i>Star Wars Republic</i> issues 61, 64, 60, and 62 and in <i>Star Wars: Jedi--Yoda</i> and were written by John Ostrander, Haden Blackman, and Jeremy Barlow, and illustrated by Brandon Badeaux, Armando Durruthy, Tomas Giorello, HOON, Ramiro Montanez, and Stacy Michalcewicz. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p><h2>NIV, Discoverer&#39;s Bible: Revised Edition, Large Print, Hardcover</h2><p>A LARGE PRINT Bible That&#x2019;s Easy to ReadFeatures include: � Complete text of the NIV translation&#x2015;just like the one Mom and Dad use.

But Shardlake is distracted from the case when his friend Roger Elliard is found brutally murdered&#x2014;the victim of a serial killer inspired by the Book of Revelation.

This thrilling fourth installment of the Shardlake series stars Justin Salinger as Shardlake, with Bryan Dick as Barak.&nbsp;Unabridged.</p><br></p><p><b>C. J. Sansom</b>&nbsp;is the author of the bestselling Shardlake series.&nbsp;The high chandeliers in the Great Hall of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were ablaze with candles, for it was late afternoon when the play began. Most members of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn were present, the barristers in their robes and their wives in their best costumes. After an hour standing watching, my back was starting to ache, and I envied the few elderly and infirm members who had brought stools.<br><br>The performance of a play at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, traditionally held in March, had been cancelled earlier in the month because of heavy snow; late in the month now, it was still unseasonably cold, the breath of actors and audience visible, wafting up like smoke to the high roofbeams. The play that year was a new Interlude, <i>The Trial of Treasure</i>, a heavy-handed moral fable with the gorgeously robed actors portraying the vices and virtues of mankind. As the actor playing Virtue, resplendent in pale robes and a long, white, false beard, lectured Dissimulation on his deceitful ways &#x2014; appropriately, perhaps, to an audience of lawyers &#x2014; my attention wandered. I cast my eyes over the shadowed faces of the audience. Treasurer Rowland, a thin-faced, acerbic old man, was eyeing the actors as though wondering whether it might have been better hiring a troupe with less expensive costumes even if this play required no elaborate scenery. Across from me I saw my old enemy Stephen Bealknap, his greedy pale blue eyes studying his fellow lawyers. Those eyes were never still, would never meet yours, and as he saw me looking at him his gaze slid away. He was perhaps the crookedest lawyer I had ever come across; it still smarted that eighteen months before I had been forced to abandon a case against him through the ruthless machinations of his patron, Richard Rich. It struck me that he looked tired, ill.<br><br>Some distance away my friend Roger Elliard, to whose house I was invited to a dinner afterwards, held his wife&#x2019;s hand. A new scene had begun; Lust had made a pact of fellowship with Inclination To Evil. Embracing him, Lust was suddenly seized with pain and crouched on his knees.<br><br>Out alas, what sudden passion is this,<br>I am so taken that I cannot stand,<br>the cramp, the cramp has touched me,<br>I shall die without remedy now out of hand.<br><br>The actor, struck down by divine judgement, stretched out a trembling hand to the audience. I saw Bealknap look at him with a sort of puzzled contempt; Roger, though, turned suddenly away. I knew why; I would talk to him later.<br><br>At last the play ended; the players bowed, the audience clapped, and we got our cold limbs into motion and stepped out into Gatehouse Court. The sun was just setting, illuminating the redbrick buildings and the melting snow in the courtyard with an umber light. People walked away to the gate, or if they lived at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn stepped homewards, wrapping their coats around them. I waited in the doorway for the Elliards, nodding to acquaintances. The audience were the only ones abroad, for it was a Saturday out of law term, Palm Sunday Eve. I looked across to the Elliards&#x2019; lodgings. All the windows were lit and servants could be seen within, bustling with trays. Dorothy&#x2019;s dinners were well known around the Inn, and even at the end of Lent, with red meat forbidden, I knew that she would have large tabling and good belly cheer for the group they had invited.<br><br>Despite the cold I felt relaxed, more peaceful than I had for a long time. In just over a week it would be Easter Sunday, and also the twenty-fifth of March, the official start of the New Year of 1543. Sometimes in recent years I had wondered at this time what grim events the coming year might bring. But I reflected that now I had only good and interesting work, and times with good friends, to look forward to. That morning while dressing I had paused to study my face in the steel mirror in my bedroom; something I seldom did, for the sight of my humped back still distressed me. I saw streaks of grey in my hair, deepening lines on my face. Yet I thought perhaps they gave me something of a distinguished look; and I had passed forty the previous year, I could no longer expect to look young.<br><br>That afternoon, before the performance, I had walked down to the Thames, for I had heard the ice was breaking up at last after the long, bitter winter. I stood at Temple Stairs and looked down at the river. True enough, huge chunks of ice tumbled against each other with great crashes and creaks amid roiling grey waters. I walked back through soft, melting snow, thinking that perhaps spring was coming at last.<br><br>Standing in the doorway of the Hall, I shivered suddenly despite my heavy fur-lined coat, for though the air was definitely warmer today it was still chill and I had never put back the flesh I lost in my bad fever eighteen months before. I jumped slightly as someone clapped me on the shoulder. It was Roger, his slim form swathed in a heavy coat. Beside him his wife Dorothy, her plump cheeks red with cold, smiled at me. Her brown hair was gathered under a round French hood set with pearls.<br><br>&#x2018;You were in a brown study, Matthew,&#x2019; Roger said. &#x2018;Reflecting on the high moral sentiments of the play?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;High as a house but heavy as a horse,&#x2019; Dorothy said.<br><br>&#x2018;That they were,&#x2019; I agreed. &#x2018;Who chose it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The Treasurer.&#x2019; Roger looked to where Rowland was talking to an ancient judge, nodding his head gravely. Roger lowered his voice. &#x2018;He wanted something that wasn&#x2019;t politically contentious. Wise in these days. But an Italian comedy would have been better.&#x2019;<br><br>We walked across the courtyard together. I noticed the snow on the Gatehouse Court fountain, which had been frozen this last three months, was almost gone, revealing patches of grey ice. Soon perhaps the fountain would be working again, its gentle plashing sounding across the court. A few coins were exposed on the ice; even with the fountain frozen people still threw money in with a prayer for victory in a case or luck in an affair of the heart; for though they might deny it, lawyers were as superstitious as other men.<br>Roger&#x2019;s steward, an old man called Elias who had been with the family for years, greeted us at the door and took me upstairs to wash my hands. Then I went into the parlour, where fat candles cast a warm buttery light on the chairs and cushions. A dozen guests, all barristers and their wives, already sat or lounged, served with wine by Elias and a boy. A roaring fire warmed the room, bringing sweet smells from the scented herbs on the wooden floor, its light glinting on the silverware on the cloth-covered table. The walls were decorated with framed portraits in the new fashion, mostly of biblical characters. Above the large fireplace stood one of the best pieces of furniture in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, Roger&#x2019;s pride and joy. It was a large, carved wooden frieze of intricate design, the branches of trees in full leaf interlaced with flowers and fruits, the heads of animals peering through, deer and boar and even a unicorn. Roger stood beside it, talking to Ambrose Loder from my chambers. His slim form was animated, his fine hands waving as he made some point to the plump barrister, who stood immobile, a sceptical look on his red face.<br><br>Dorothy stood beside him, wearing an expression of good-natured amusement, her colourful clothes a contrast to the black robes of the two lawyers. She wore a green damask dress with gold piping down the front, and a high collar open at the throat; it suited her well. Seeing me, she excused herself and came across.<br><br>I had known Dorothy near twenty years. She was the daughter of a serjeant in my first chambers. We had both been in our early twenties then and I had at once been attracted to Dorothy&#x2019;s elegance, wit and kind nature &#x2014; a rare combination. She seemed to like my company too, never seemed to mind my bent back, and we became good friends. After a while I dared to think of trying to turn friendship into something more. I had given no signs of my real feelings, though, and therefore had only myself to blame when I learned that Roger, my friend and colleague, had already proposed marriage and been accepted. He later said &#x2014; and I believed him &#x2014; that he had not realized my feelings for Dorothy.

Reissue.</p><p><b>Patricia Wentworth</b> (1878&#x2013;1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.&#x201c;Miss Wentworth is a first-rate storyteller.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Patricia Wentworth has created a great detective in Miss Silver, the little old lady who nobody notices, but who in turn notices everything.&#x201d; &#x2014;Paula Gosling, author of the Jack Stryker mystery series&nbsp;&#x201c;Miss Wentworth&#x2019;s plot is ingenious, her characterization acute, her solution satisfying.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Scotsman </i><br></p><h2>Benet&#39;s Reader&#39;s Encyclopedia</h2><p>Here, completely revised, updated and expanded is the classic reference on world literature--the only encyclopedia on the subject in one volume.

Narrator William Dufris&#39;s skilled delivery of the fantasy of reliving one&#39;s life has just the right tone of wise hindsight. Dufris astutely conveys Winston&#39;s complex emotions as he comes to realize that knowledge of the future is at once a blessing and a curse. With a layered tone, Dufris molds a character who understands what he must do to correct his past mistakes, but who seems doomed to fail no matter what action he takes. Through it all, Dufris injects a subtle questioning into Winston&#39;s voice as he ponders--&#34;Why me?&#34; L.B. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Cloudstreet: A Novel</h2><p>Hailed as a classic, Tim Winton's masterful family saga is both a paean to working-class Australians and an unflinching examination of the human heart's capacity for sorrow, joy, and endless gradations in between. An award-winning work, <i>Cloudstreet</i> exemplifies the brilliant ability of fiction to captivate and inspire. <br> Struggling to rebuild their lives after being touched by disaster, the Pickle family, who've inherited a big house called Cloudstreet in a suburb of Perth, take in the God-fearing Lambs as tenants. The Lambs have suffered their own catastrophes, and determined to survive, they open up a grocery on the ground floor. From 1944 to 1964, the shared experiences of the two overpopulated clans -- running the gamut from drunkenness, adultery, and death to resurrection, marriage, and birth -- bond them to each other and to the bustling, haunted house in ways no one could have anticipated.</p><p>Tim Winton grew up on the coast of Western Australia, where he continues to live. He is the author of eighteen books. His epic novel <i>Cloudstreet</i> was adapted for the theater and has been performed around the world. His two most recent novels, <i>Dirt Music</i> and <i>The Riders</i>, were both shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. He has won the prestigious Miles Franklin Award three times, and in 1998 the Australian National Trust declared Winton a national living treasure. <i>The Turning</i> has already won the 2005 Christina Stead Prize for Fiction.With sensitivity and vision, novelist Tim Winton creates an Australian classic that takes the listener into the world of two wholly believable working-class families in post-WWII Perth. The Pickles family inherits, but cannot afford to keep, Cloudstreet, a rambling, ramshackled house--so they take in the Lambs as their boarders. The Pickles are an irreligious, indolent lot, while the Lambs are pious and hard-working. Peter Hosking's performance is true to Winton's unsentimental exploration into humankind's ability to love and survive amid adversity. Hosking handles the mundane and the mystical with equal assurance. His characterizations, including an aboriginal ghost and a talking pig, are earthy, real, and frequently hilarious. Hosking makes the most of Winton's honesty, wit, and original imagery. S.J.H.

His wit, his charm, his inventiveness&#x2014;even his grandfatherly appearance&#x2014;are legendary. But this image obscures the scandals that dogged him throughout his life. In <i>The Loyal Son,</i> award-winning historian Daniel Mark Epstein throws the spotlight on one of the more enigmatic aspects of Franklin&#x2019;s biography: his complex and confounding relationship with his illegitimate son William.<br><br> When he was twenty-four, Franklin fathered a child with a woman who was not his wife. He adopted the boy, raised him, and educated him to be his aide. Ben and William became inseparable. After the famous kite-in-a-thunderstorm experiment, it was William who proved that the electrical charge in a lightning bolt travels from the ground up, not from the clouds down. On a diplomatic mission to London, it was William who charmed London society. He was invited to walk in the procession of the coronation of George III; Ben was not.<br><br> The outbreak of the American Revolution caused a devastating split between father and son. By then, William was royal governor of New Jersey, while Ben was one of the foremost champions of American independence. In 1776, the Continental Congress imprisoned William for treason. George Washington made efforts to win William&#x2019;s release, while his father, to the world&#x2019;s astonishment, appeared to have abandoned him to his fate.<br><br> A fresh take on the combustible politics of the age of independence, <i>The Loyal Son</i> is a gripping account of how the agony of the American Revolution devastated one of America&#x2019;s most distinguished families. Like Nathaniel Philbrick and David McCullough, Epstein is a storyteller first and foremost, a historian who weaves together fascinating incidents discovered in long-neglected documents to draw us into the private world of the men and women who made America.<br><br><b>&#x201c;The history of loyalist William Franklin and his famous father has been told before but not as fully or as well as it is by Daniel Mark Epstein in <i>The Loyal Son</i>.

Daniel Mark Epstein lives in Baltimore.PREFACE<br> &nbsp;<br><i>A Night Journey, 1731</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br><br>Works of fiction often benefit from prefaces that are non-fictional statements. These are usually personal and sometimes historical remarks by the writer that help us find our way into the story. Is it possible that a book of history might profit from a nearly fictional preface? Might an author part from convention just long enough to favor the reader by turning the tables? I don&#x2019;t know if it has ever been done before; but, begging the reader&#x2019;s indulgence I mean to try it. <br> When I am done with my preface, I will resume my vocation as a historian with no constellation to guide my craft but the facts.<br><br> &nbsp;<br>On a starry night in April 1731, a young man in a borrowed two- wheeled shay drove along the Lower Post Road from Burlington, New Jersey, toward Cooper&#x2019;s Ferry, where he hoped to cross the river into Philadelphia before daybreak. There was enough of the moon in its last quarter to light the muddy road.<br><br> Beside him on the seat was a packing crate lined with blankets, and wrapped in the blankets andwound in bunting was a baby. Right now the baby was sleeping, lulled by the rhythm of the horse&#x2019;s hooves and&nbsp;the easy jouncing of the carriage upon its creaking wheels. The driver <br>guided the horse carefully in the hope that a bump in the road wouldn&#x2019;t set the baby to crying again. Just eight months old, he had never been long away from his mother. She had explained a few hours ago that if the baby cried he was to pick him up, just so, and put him up on the shoulder and pat him, once, twice, and again to raise the air in his belly. Then rock him or sing to him and he would go back to sleep. He was a good baby, she said, sobbing. &#x201c;He does not cry or fuss but when he is hungry or raw or has the air in his belly.&#x201d;<br><br> She had weaned him early in anticipation of this terrible hour. In a separate compartment of the crate were a pewter sucking pot, a silver pap boat and spoon for pabulum, and a covered jar of mixed flour, bread, and water. He knew nothing about babies but meant to figure it out.<br><br> Franklin was famously capable. In the fullness of his twenty-four years he had proved this to himself and a few other people and was sometimes frightened of his own power. The advantage was partly an inborn mental endowment, a knack for absorbing knowledge and put- ting it to work in useful and novel ways. In spite of little schooling he had mastered Latin, French, ancient history, and strange branches of mathematics such as the magic square. He was a wunderkind, at six- teen already demonstrating a command of language that would make him the greatest writer of topical essays in America. A precocious busi- nessman, at seventeen he had replaced his brother as editor of <i>The New-England Courant; </i>now he was owner of <i>The Pennsylvania Gazette </i>and the colony&#x2019;s official printer.<br><br> All of these accomplishments might be understood as functions of intellect and a hearty constitution. But he had more mysterious talents: an ability to see things, events, objects, before they appeared to his senses; also his potent influence upon people of all ages&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t account for it and preferred not to think too much about it, but this was a force he had come to rely upon without conscience.<br><br> Franklin believed in God but shunned the church. At nineteen he had published a pamphlet arguing against free will. As God was infi- nitely wise, good, and almighty, nothing in His creation could be wrong. Therefore vice and virtue were empty distinctions. By and by,though, he had begun to see the danger in this creed. He had allowed&nbsp;a large debt to a friend go unpaid. He treated his brother badly, first by running out on his apprenticeship in Boston, then by returning there in triumph a year later, flaunting his new wealth, flashing gold coins, embarrassing James in front of his staff. He had treated his fianc�e, Deborah, terribly at one time, neglecting her while indulging his pas- sion for low women.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Lacking a proper philosophy, religion, or supervision, he realized there was no end of mischief and misery he might cause the world. Look what had happened in the past year during a time when he was trying so hard to mend his ways.<br><br> The carriage hit a bump and the baby stirred in the wooden box, murmuring, and then fell silent again.<br> Two women were in love with Benjamin Franklin. One he loved with all his heart and soul; the other was his wife, who was waiting for him, weary and anxious, in their rooms on Market Street in Philadel- phia. The woman he had left behind, weeping, at the door of a mansion on the outskirts of Burlington was the mother of the child who lay beside him.<br><br> He had met the woman at a lively dinner gathering at the home of the surveyor general in Burlington three years ago, when Franklin and his business partner were printing paper money for the province of New Jersey. She and her husband, Captain Joseph Bradford, were seated when he entered the parlor. The first thing he noticed was the sheen of her long, abundant hair, nearly black, pinned back, strands touching her bare shoulders, and eyes of china blue that made a bril- liant contrast. The second thing he noticed as she rose and extended a slender hand was how tall she was, almost equal to his five feet ten inches.<br><br> They were seated together at the long table as the two youngest of the company, and because it was hoped that the twenty-two-year-old writer, with his wit and vast reading, would entertain the captain&#x2019;s wife, herself a woman of unusual erudition. Her father, a rich merchant and amateur scientist, had novel ideas about women and spared no expense on books and tutors for his youngest daughter, Marion. It had stood her in good stead. She had married the adoring Captain Bradford,&nbsp;master of two merchant vessels, who was at sea for years at a time while <br>she managed his business affairs on land, having complete power of attorney and notable financial literacy.<br><br> After one hour in Mrs. Bradford&#x2019;s company, Franklin was not quite sure whether she found him entertaining or ridiculous. She smiled agreeably. At times she fairly beamed, raising an eyebrow, whether what this bachelor said was funny or not, as if she laughed at some inner joke that might be at his expense, or perhaps a distant memory awakened in her that had nothing to do with him. She was certainly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, with the clear cameo fea- tures of a Titian Madonna. She seemed much older than he (she was then twenty-eight) and more worldly-wise, a wife, woman of affairs, and mother of a ten-year-old daughter.<br><br> At the other end of the table the surveyor general, a judge, their wives, and several aldermen sipped wine and talked business with Cap- tain Bradford, who knew everything about the balance of trade. He was a jovial mariner of fifty with thick side-whiskers and merry eyes. He would be sailing for England in May with a cargo of tobacco and lumber, returning, God willing, in October with broadcloth and salt. Then off again on a winter run to Barbados.<br><br> Captain Bradford and his wife owned two homes, the mansion out- side Burlington and a smaller house in the port city of Perth Amboy near Raritan Bay and the ship channel. She first wrote to the young printer from Perth Amboy on May 17, 1728, asking if he might call upon her in Burlington during the following week. She had questions about the currency.<br><br> There in the twilight of her book-lined drawing room, as night closed in around them, it took them all of fifteen minutes to realize they were in love&#x2014;hardly enough time to light the lamps. These free spirits, unsupervised, without religion, and agreeing that vice and vir- tue were empty distinctions, gave in to nature and high spirits. They soon found that they could not get enough of each other.<br><br> That spring and summer, in Burlington County and in Philadel- phia, in inns and courtyards, meadows, haylofts, and rowboats, they made love as lovers have done since time began and as they believed no lovers had ever made love before, with enthusiasm, imagination, and&nbsp;acrobatic virtuosity. They did things not to be recorded here. They were&nbsp;cleverly discreet. And of course they took care to see that Mrs. Brad- ford did not get pregnant. She knew all about that, and he trusted her to supply what he lacked in experience.<br><br>&nbsp; When the leaves turned and it was time for the captain to come home, they were not quite exhausted, but discovered the fire that had warmed them in the summer had given way to a glow that was inex- tinguishable: a sort of tenderness and deep understanding of kindred spirits. Now each must appeal to the other&#x2019;s highest nature. They must not meet again. They must consider not only themselves, but others.<br><br> So in November, Franklin wrote his famous &#x201c;Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion&#x201d; in which he embraces virtue and goodness as the only means to leading a happy life. During the next few years he would cre- ate a program calculated to achieve moral perfection, by checking off cardinal virtues one by one on a chart: temperance, frugality, justice, moderation . . . twelve in all, with the last being chastity. By concen- trating on one per week, then repeating, in a year or two one might become a saint. He managed to stay away from Marion Bradford for more than eight months during which he pined for her. He took con- solation in the company of his old flame Deborah Read, a handsome woman he had known since they were seventeen. She, too, was mar- ried, but disastrously; her husband had run off years ago, so she was for most purposes available, if not legally marriageable.<br><br> But in the summer of 1729 he received a letter from Marion in- forming him that the captain was departing upon a triangular trade route from Sandy Hook bearing rum to the Gold Coast, slaves from Africa to the West Indies, then molasses to England. Her husband would not return before late winter eighteen months hence. This was more temptation than the aspiring saint could bear, not to mention Mrs. Bradford. They picked up their affair where they had left off, but with renewed intensity after months of longing, and the piquancy of knowing that this must come to an end, the sweet torment of swearing oaths that they would never see each other again, of tearful, high- minded partings, and then delicious, wicked falls from grace.<br><br> After Christmas they made love in a damp hunting lodge, and in March she told him she was pregnant. This was a sobering development. What could she do? The pregnancy could be concealed withproper clothing until the end, and then she would travel. Her daughter would be away at school. There was a friend in Richmond who could be trusted. Her husband must never know; he wanted more children, would never forgive her. She would be ruined. Benjamin must go away and never see her again. She would write to him. <br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br>He had seen her one more time before that long night in April 1731. Drawn by an overwhelming impulse, he went to her upon her return from Richmond, learning she had been unwilling to give up the newborn until she had weaned him. He found her alone in the house near Burlington with only one servant so old and frail she appeared ready to carry Marion&#x2019;s secret to the grave any moment. The mother was both happy to see him and very sad. The boy child in his cradle, with the promise of a smile, was perfectly formed, as one could see when she undressed him. He did not touch the baby. He promised her that he would return when the boy was weaned and see to it that he was placed in a good home. It was the least he could do.<br><br> Franklin had been in fitful negotiations with Deborah Read for several months concerning their domestic arrangements. She wanted to marry him but couldn&#x2019;t until there was proof of her husband&#x2019;s de- mise. Franklin wanted a wife for all the usual reasons. He was fantasti- cally busy. He did not want to assume responsibility for the enormous debts of Deborah&#x2019;s late husband should he prove to be dead, which colonial law demanded. One solution was for them to set up house- keeping together and declare themselves husband and wife, above the law, which appealed to him more than to her. They argued over it, bar- gaining. Now there was another pawn on the board&#x2014;this baby. It might tip the balance for Deborah Read. After a heated discussion, she consented to raise the bastard under two conditions: Franklin was never to see the child&#x2019;s mother again, whoever she was, and &#x201c;the wom- an&#x2019;s identity must never be revealed, even here, to <i>me</i>. At best the world may come to believe he is ours; at worst he will be known as a found- ling orphan.&#x201d; <br><br> Deborah moved into Ben&#x2019;s house in September 1730, beginning<br> their common-law union. Never gregarious, she served her husband, traveling occasionally to visit her siblings. <br><br> In April he crossed the Delaware River with his baby. He drove the shay along Front Street in view of the sailing ships, turning up Market Street in the dawn. It was a new world that needed good fathers. A ship&#x2019;s horn blared, and sounds of the city waking woke the baby beside him. At an alley between Second and Third Streets the infant whim- pered. Then he began to cry in earnest. They were almost home. He did not want to bring this baby to his wife screaming and crying. He reined the horse, jumped down and tied him to a hitching post, and threw a blanket over him. He got back up on the carriage seat, gently lifted the baby from the cradle, and began rocking him side to side as he had seen women do. The baby cried. He put him up on his shoulder and patted his back, just so. He began to sing.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Hush ye, my bairnie<br> Bonny wee laddie <br>When you&#x2019;re a man</i><br> <i>You shall follow your daddy . . .</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Franklin loved to sing old tunes. It calmed the child, and soon he was sound asleep once more.<br> Leaving the horse and shay in the rising light he carried the bundle to the house and up the stairs to the bedroom where his wife was half asleep. He laid the child in the middle of the bed and got in beside him. When Deborah&#x2019;s eyes were fully opened, she first saw the baby sleeping between them.<br><br> &#x201c;His name is William,&#x201d; her husband whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>The night journey of young Ben Franklin may have happened much as it is described above. The persons and the circumstances were real (excepting the Bradfords) and the events highly probable. But there is no record of them. So it is not history. It is scaffolding. Like the&nbsp;wooden frame that follows the form of the underside of an arch while&nbsp;the marble stones are laid upon it, until the last capstone is in place and the arch is self-supporting from the weight of gravity, the little story may now be taken down.<br><br>&nbsp; What lies ahead is the stone arch of history.</p><h2>Roots of Style: Weaving Together Life, Love, and Fashion</h2><p><i>Roots of Style </i>is a rare look into the mind, life, and journey of one of our generation&#x2019;s most coveted fashion designers, Isabel Toledo.

They get that whale to go over a rope farther out of the water than most of us can imagine. This is a great challenge�as great as the ones you and I face as parents, coaches or managers.<br><br> Can you imagine the typical American managerial approach to this situation? The first thing we would do would be to get that rope right up there at 22 feet�no sense celebrating shortcomings. We call that goal-setting, or strategic planning. With the goal clearly defined, we now have to figure out a way to motivate the whale. So we take a bucket of fish and put it right above that 22-foot rope�don�t pay the whale unless it performs. Then we have to give direction. We lean over from our nice high and dry perch and say, �Jump, whale!�<br><br> And the whale stays right where it is. <br><br> So how do the trainers at Sea World do it? Their number one priority is to reinforce the behavior that they want repeated�in this case, to get the whale or porpoise to go over the rope. They influence the environment every way they can so that it supports the principle of making sure that the whale can�t fail. They start with the rope below the surface of the water, in a position where the whale can�t help but do what�s expected of it. Every time the whale goes over the rope, it gets positive reinforcement. It gets fed fish, patted, played with, and most important, it gets that reinforcement.<br><br> But what happens when the whale goes <i>under</i> the rope? Nothing�no electric shock, no constructive criticism, no developmental feedback and no warnings in the personnel file. Whales are taught that their negative behavior will not be acknowledged.<br><br> Positive reinforcement is the cornerstone of that simple principle that produces such spectacular results. And as the whale begins to go over the rope more often than under, the trainers begin to raise the rope. It must be raised slowly enough so that the whale doesn�t starve, either physically or emotionally.<br><br> The simple lesson to be learned from the whale trainers is to <i>over-celebrate</i>. Make a big deal out of the good and little stuff that we want consistently. Secondly, <i>under-criticize</i>. People know when they screw up. What they need is help. If we under-criticize, punish and discipline less than is expected, people will not forget the event and usually will not repeat it. <br><br> In my opinion, most successful businesses today are doing things right more than 95 percent of the time. Yet what do we spend the majority of our time giving feedback on? That�s right�the 2, 3, 4, maybe even the 5 percent of things that we don�t want repeated and didn�t want to happen in the first place.<br><br> We need to set up the circumstances so that people can�t fail. Over-celebrate, under-criticize�and know how far to raise the rope.<br><br> <i>Charles A. Coonradt</i> <br><br><br> <p>�1996 Charles A. Coonradt. All rights reserved.

But he is just as comfortable in a school auditorium, rousing groups of students with his unique style of real-life wisdom. Having addressed thousands of high-school and middle- school students over the years, Hill is ready to take his message to an even wider audience. Letters to a Young Brother is drawn from the humbling life lessons he learned on the road to his Ivy League education and beyond. Inspired by the countless letters and e-mails he has received from teens, Hill Harper set out to write a series of letters to young people that would catch the attention of even the most reluctant readers.</p> <p>The result is a motivational but approachable book full of encouragement on a wide array of hot topics, particularly among young African-American and Hispanic men. From the challenges of getting a good education and making it through college to the media&#x2019;s destructive emphasis on material wealth, <b>Letters to a Young Brother</b> delivers eye-opening answers. Reminiscent of Marian Wright Edelman&#x2019;s <b>New York Times</b> bestseller, <b>The Measure of Our Success: A Letter to My Children and Yours</b>, Hill Harper&#x2019;s words will resonate for years to come.<br> </p></p><p>Currently starring in <i>CSI: NY</i>, Hill Harper has appeared in numerous prime- time television shows and feature films, including <i>Beloved</i> and <i>He Got Game</i>. He graduated magna cum laude from Brown University with a B.A. and cum laude from Harvard Law School. He also holds a master&#x2019;s degree in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government. He was recently named one of <i>People</i> magazine&#x2019;s Sexiest Men Alive.Inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's <i>Letters to a Young Poet</i>, Harper, a young black actor and graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School, offers similar inspiration to young men clamoring for advice and encouragement at a time when popular culture offers little positive direction. Interspersed throughout are e-mail inquiries from young men and Harper's responses and those of other celebrities, including Nas, Venus Williams, and Barack Obama. He devotes separate chapters to school and work, sex, and life aspirations, tackling such issues as single parenthood, sexually transmitted diseases, the allure of materialism, and the power of words and faith. Harper offers his personal story: a young man brought up by a demanding father, who developed a relationship with his mother only as he grew older. He views the youth of today as an evolved species, like the latest model car, with improvements that come from the experiences of those who came before. Although aimed at young black men, this book, with its contemporary language and approach, should have appeal for youth of both sexes and all races. <i>Vernon Ford</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Originally staged to celebrate the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots of 1969, which mark the birth of the Gay Pride movement and the eventual recognition of rights for gays and lesbians, Gay Pride Month now takes over the West Village in a parade that attracts close to a million people of all genders, sexualities, ethnicities, and classes. The four-on-the-floor thump of house music pumps as caravans of divas, boob-flapping biker gals, and costumed creatures preen, primp, and pucker for cameras and spectators on the street. Equally colorful is the crowd, clapping and cheering for the performers before parading about town themselves. <br><br>As a follow-up to his crazy successful, fashion and pop culture-influencing book of Hip Hop's early days, Back In The Days, photographer <b>Jamel Shabazz</b> takes a sharp turn in bringing to light a vastly original - and under-documented&#x2014;emerging subculture in Last Sunday In June. Drawing from an enormous cast of eye-catching characters, Shabazz showcases an extraordinary collection of luscious lesbians, tasteful transsexuals, and dramatic drag queens done up in their Sunday best to celebrate Gay Pride.</p><p><b>Jamel Shabazz</b> is the author of <i>Back in the Days </i>(powerHouse Books, 2001). His photographs have appeared in publications including <i>The Source</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>TRACE</i>, <i>Flaunt</i>, <i>Mass Appeal</i>, <i>Jalouse</i>, <i>Black Book</i>, <i>OneWorld</i>, and <i>Honey</i>. Shabazz&#x2019;s work has been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Kravets/Wehby Gallery, New York; by Kangol at the Dazed &amp; Confused Gallery, London; by adidas and Lodown at adidas Originals, Berlin; and in Trace&#x2019;s True Signs, Paris. His debut book, <i>Back in the Days</i>, has received astounding critical acclaim and commercial success since its initial release in January 2001. Shabazz was born in Brooklyn and lives in Long Island, New York.Commemorating New York's Stonewall Riots of June 1969, the last Sunday (and Saturday) of every June finds Greenwich Village electric with gay pride events and activity. In 1990, two young women in New York's Washington Square Park suggested that Shabazz, a documentary photographer, check it out, after he asked them where to find "drama and flava." After some initial discomfort, Shabazz began documenting the celebration annually, showing off the diversity and energy of the gay community. Moving from people in metallic outfits to those in very little at all, Shabazz captures picketers, revelers and people in love; transgender, multiracial, cross-class and totally engaged, Pride Day draws celebrants from around the world. Shabazz previously published Back in the Days, a collection of his shots of street gangs in New York in the 1980s; as New York Times reporter Kalefa Sanneh writes in an included essay, "Where many street photographers emphasize the dignity of their subjects, Shabazz seems just as interested in their glamour." In pages of photographs uninterrupted by text, the glamour and dignity of the queer community sparkles. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Indian Motorcycles (Enthusiast Color Series)</h2><p>Recounts the history of the motorcycles marketed under the Indian brand name, including racers, Scout and Chief models, and four-cylinder motorcycles</p><p><p>From its earliest single-cylinder &#x201c;motocycles&#x201d; of 1901 through the bitter end of production in 1953, Indian inspired a fierce loyalty in its riders.

She lives in Westchester, New York.An Invisible Thread <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, lady, do you have any spare change?&#x201d;<br> <br>This was the first thing he said to me, on 56th Street in New York City, right around the corner from Broadway, on a sunny September day.<br> <br>And when I heard him, I didn&#x2019;t really hear him. His words were part of the clatter, like a car horn or someone yelling for a cab. They were, you could say, just noise&#x2014;the kind of nuisance New Yorkers learn to tune out. So I walked right by him, as if he wasn&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>But then, just a few yards past him, I stopped.<br> <br>And then&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m still not sure why I did this&#x2014;I came back.<br> <br>I came back and I looked at him, and I realized he was just a boy. Earlier, out of the corner of my eye, I had noticed he was young. But now, looking at him, I saw that he was a child&#x2014;tiny body, sticks for arms, big round eyes. He wore a burgundy sweatshirt that was smudged and frayed and ratty burgundy sweatpants to match. He had scuffed white sneakers with untied laces, and his fingernails were dirty. But his eyes were bright and there was a general sweetness about him. He was, I would soon learn, eleven years old.<br> <br>He stretched his palm toward me, and he asked again, &#x201c;Excuse me, lady, do you have any spare change? I am hungry.&#x201d;<br> <br>What I said in response may have surprised him, but it really shocked me.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to McDonald&#x2019;s and buy you lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I have a cheeseburger?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a Big Mac?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a Diet Coke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, how about a thick chocolate shake and French fries?&#x201d;<br> <br>I told him he could have anything he wanted. And then I asked him if I could join him for lunch.<br> <br>He thought about it for a second.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he finally said.<br> <br>We had lunch together that day, at McDonald&#x2019;s.<br> <br>And after that, we got together every Monday.<br> <br>For the next 150 Mondays.<br> <br>His name is Maurice, and he changed my life.<br> <br><br> <br>Why did I stop and go back to Maurice? It is easier for me to tell you why I ignored him in the first place. I ignored him, very simply, because he wasn&#x2019;t in my schedule.<br> <br>You see, I am a woman whose life runs on schedules. I make appointments, I fill slots, I micromanage the clock. I bounce around from meeting to meeting, ticking things off a list. I am not merely punctual; I am fifteen minutes early for any and every engagement. This is how I live; it is who I am&#x2014;but some things in life do not fit neatly into a schedule.<br> <br>Rain, for example. On the day I met Maurice&#x2014;September 1, 1986&#x2014;a huge storm swept over the city, and I awoke to darkness and hammering rain. It was Labor Day weekend and the summer was slipping away, but I had tickets to the U.S. Open tennis tournament that afternoon&#x2014;box seats, three rows from center court. I wasn&#x2019;t a big tennis fan, but I loved having such great seats; to me, the tickets were tangible evidence of how successful I&#x2019;d become. In 1986 I was thirty-five years old and an advertising sales executive for USA Today, and I was very good at what I did, which was building relationships through sheer force of personality. Maybe I wasn&#x2019;t exactly where I wanted to be in my life&#x2014;after all, I was still single, and another summer had come and gone without me finding that someone special&#x2014;but by any standard I was doing pretty well. Taking clients to the Open and sitting courtside for free was just another measure of how far this girl from a working-class Long Island town had come.<br> <br>But then the rains washed out the day, and by noon the Open had been postponed. I puttered around my apartment, tidied up a bit, made some calls, and read the paper until the rain finally let up in mid-afternoon. I grabbed a sweater and dashed out for a walk. I may not have had a destination, but I had a definite purpose&#x2014;to enjoy the fall chill in the air and the peeking sun on my face, to get a little exercise, to say good-bye to summer. Stopping was never part of the plan.<br> <br>And so, when Maurice spoke to me, I just kept going. Another thing to remember is that this was New York in the 1980s, a time when vagrants and panhandlers were as common a sight in the city as kids on bikes or moms with strollers. The nation was enjoying an economic boom, and on Wall Street new millionaires were minted every day. But the flip side was a widening gap between the rich and the poor, and nowhere was this more evident than on the streets of New York City. Whatever wealth was supposed to trickle down to the middle class did not come close to reaching the city&#x2019;s poorest, most desperate people, and for many of them the only recourse was living on the streets. After a while you got used to the sight of them&#x2014;hard, gaunt men and sad, haunted women, wearing rags, camped on corners, sleeping on grates, asking for change. It is tough to imagine anyone could see them and not feel deeply moved by their plight. Yet they were just so prevalent that most people made an almost subconscious decision to simply look the other way&#x2014;to, basically, ignore them. The problem seemed so vast, so endemic, that stopping to help a single panhandler could feel all but pointless. And so we swept past them every day, great waves of us going on with our lives and accepting that there was nothing we could really do to help.<br> <br>There had been one homeless man I briefly came to know the winter before I met Maurice. His name was Stan, and he lived on the street off Sixth Avenue, not far from my apartment. Stan was a stocky guy in his midforties who owned a pair of wool gloves, a navy blue skullcap, old work shoes, and a few other things stuffed into plastic shopping bags, certainly not any of the simple creature comforts we take for granted&#x2014;a warm blanket, for instance, or a winter coat. He slept on a subway grate, and the steam from the trains kept him alive.<br> <br>One day I asked if he&#x2019;d like a cup of coffee, and he answered that he would, with milk and four sugars, please. And it became part of my routine to bring him a cup of coffee on the way to work. I&#x2019;d ask Stan how he was doing and I&#x2019;d wish him good luck, until one morning he was gone and the grate was just a grate again, not Stan&#x2019;s spot. And just like that he vanished from my life, without a hint of what happened to him. I felt sad that he was no longer there and I often wondered what became of him, but I went on with my life and over time I stopped thinking about Stan. I hate to believe my compassion for him and others like him was a casual thing, but if I&#x2019;m really honest with myself, I&#x2019;d have to say that it was. I cared, but I didn&#x2019;t care enough to make a real change in my life to help. I was not some heroic do-gooder. I learned, like most New Yorkers, to tune out the nuisance.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Then came Maurice. I walked past him to the corner, onto Broadway, and, halfway to the other side in the middle of the avenue, just stopped. I stood there for a few moments, in front of cars waiting for the light to change, until a horn sounded and startled me. I turned around and hustled back to the sidewalk. I don&#x2019;t remember thinking about it or even making a conscious decision to turn around. I just remember doing it.<br> <br>Looking back all these years later, I believe there was a strong, unseen connection that pulled me back to Maurice. It&#x2019;s something I call an invisible thread. It is, as the old Chinese proverb tells us, something that connects two people who are destined to meet, regardless of time and place and circumstance. Some legends call it the red string of fate; others, the thread of destiny. It is, I believe, what brought Maurice and me to the same stretch of sidewalk in a vast, teeming city&#x2014;just two people out of eight million, somehow connected, somehow meant to be friends.<br> <br>Look, neither of us is a superhero, nor even especially virtuous. When we met we were just two people with complicated pasts and fragile dreams. But somehow we found each other, and we became friends.<br> <br>And that, you will see, made all the difference for us both.</p><h2>Agincourt: The King; the Campaign; the Battle</h2><p>In this landmark study of Agincourt, prize-winning author Juliet Barker draws upon a huge range of sources, published and unpublished, English and French, to give a compelling account of a battle upon which so many legends have been built.

A fierce poise, forged by Anna&#x2019;s lonely childhood, carried her through her father&#x2019;s resistance to her writing &#x2014; which prompted her to change her name from Gorenko to Akhmatova, a name taken from a Tartar ancestor - and her flawed but passionate love affairs. We see Akhmatova&#x2019;s work banned from 1925 until 1940, and banned again following World War II, when the Union of Soviet Writers labeled her &#x201c;half nun, half harlot.&#x201d; We see her steadfast resistance to Stalin during her hopeful but unsuccessful attempt to win her son&#x2019;s release from prison. We see her abiding loyalty to such friends as Mandelstam, Shostakovich and Pasternak as they faced Stalinist oppression. And we see how, through everything, Akhmatova continued to write, her poetry giving voice to the Russian people by whom she was, and still is, deeply loved. <br><br><i>Anna of All the Russias</i> takes us into the days and nights of an icon.

The dark and glittering verses which open Akhmatova&#x2019;s Poem Without a Hero circle about her memories of that year, the final moments of a corrupt and glamorous world. In the poem, Akhmatova is waiting for guests to celebrate New Year 1941. Candles have been lit, wine and crystal set out when, instead of her expected visitors, a sinister phantasmagoria of dead friends crowd in upon her, dressed as mummers. Their presence calls up St. Petersburg as it once was, when Akhmatova was twenty-four, a fashionable young woman already famous as a poet, with the violent upheavals of the twentieth century not yet under way.<br><br> In 1913 St. Petersburg was an Imperial capital, with a black and yellow flag flying over the Winter Palace, private carriages pulled by thoroughbred horses with footmen in uniform who rode on the running-boards. There were trams and trolleys and occasional motor cars. Enticing shop windows on the Nevsky Prospekt had oysters from Paris, lobsters from Ostend and &#x201c;fruitcakes, smelling salts, Pears soap, playing cards, picture puzzles, striped blazers . . . and football jerseys in the colours of Oxford and Cambridge.&#x201d; On the sunny side of Nevsky Prospekt bookstores sold the latest poetry.<br><br> Built below sea level, at the edge of the Baltic, St. Petersburg was always an unnatural city. Thousands of slave labourers died of disease and hunger to realise Peter the Great&#x2019;s grand design of a window on the West. Even after he had declared St. Petersburg his new capital, wolves boldly entered the city at night as late as 1712, and occasionally devoured their prey in broad daylight. Floods constantly overwhelmed the islands, and in 1721 Peter himself was nearly drowned on Nevsky Prospekt. It is the city of Pushkin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bronze Horseman,&#x201d; where a poor clerk&#x2019;s lover is carried away by the waters and Falconet&#x2019;s grand statue of Peter pursues him when he dares to protest. It was Gogol&#x2019;s city of shadows and phantoms. The poverty and squalor of the streets and squares still remained much as in Dostoevsky&#x2019;s nightmare vision.<br><br> Akhmatova called St. Petersburg her cradle, even though she was not born there. In her autobiographical jottings, she describes childhood streets filled with organ-grinders, Tatar ragmen and tinsmiths, the houses painted different shades of red, front entrances scented with the perfume of ladies and the cigarettes of passing gentlemen, back staircases smelling of coffee, bliny, mushrooms and, frequently, cats.<br><br> 1913 was the Jubilee of three hundred years of the Romanov dynasty, and in February all the main streets of the city were decorated, statues garlanded and portraits of a long line of tsars pasted to the front of buildings. Everything was done to impress foreign and provincial visitors. Electricity illuminated the Winter Palace, the golden spire of the Admiralty arch, other columns, arches and double-headed eagles. The rich dressed with flamboyance. At one opera house, in 1913, for a performance of Glinka&#x2019;s patriotic A Life for the Tsar, the boxes blazed with jewels and tiaras. For the nobility, most of whom lived on or near the Nevsky Prospekt, there were balls and banquets. Everywhere military music celebrated the absolute rule of Nicholas II, and the magnificence of his empire.<br><br> On the February day which inaugurated the Jubilee celebrations, the Imperial family drove in an open carriage towards Kazan Cathedral. To protect the Tsar on his first public appearance since the revolution in 1905, one battalion of horse guards rode in front of his carriage and another behind. Imperial Guards lined the route. Tourists from all over the empire, and foreign dignitaries from the rest of Europe, were staggered by the splendour of the occasion.<br><br> Behind these central areas, St. Petersburg remained a city of filth and disease. Many factories were allowed to discharge their waste into the rivers and canals. With a cholera outbreak on average once every three years, the death rate was the highest of any capital city in Europe. Water had to be fetched in buckets and boiled before it was safe, but thirsty workers gave little attention to this and the general domestic water supply was a breeding-ground for typhus as well as cholera. London had eradicated similar problems in the nineteenth century by building a new system of sewers. No attempt was made to improve the situation in St. Petersburg until 1917.<br><br> Nicholas thought of himself as divinely appointed and the many peasants who still wrote directly to him for help saw him as a father who felt compassion for their difficulties. Over Nicholas&#x2019; vast empire, however, the memory of 1905 remained raw. Reprisals had included executions of suspected radicals and mass violence against ethnic minorities, particularly Jews, incited by the Tsar&#x2019;s Prime<br><br> Minister, Stolypin. The ruling authorities remained suspicious of Poles and Jews, who were always regarded as likely revolutionaries, and indeed 1913 was the year of the Beilis trial, with its medieval trumped-up charge of child murder against a totally innocent Jew. Nevertheless, in 1913 Nicholas was confirmed in his delusion that his people loved him.<br><br> Of the skills required to run a country in pre-revolutionary ferment, it has to be said Nicholas had none. He was a shy man and had always been treated like a child by his family. He danced gracefully, rode well and spoke good English but his agonised cry when his father died at forty-nine was entirely appropriate: &#x201c;What is going to happen to me and all of Russia? I was not prepared to be a Tsar. I never wanted to become one.&#x201d; Nor was his Empress a popular<br><br> figure. She did not enjoy public occasions, and found the Jubilee celebrations a strain, even withdrawing from a gala performance at<br><br> the Maryinsky Theatre. She had acceded to the Russian throne at twenty-two and, although regarded as German by the Russians, she was in fact English. She ordered factory-produced furniture from the London department store Maples for the Winter Palace, where it looked out of place alongside the classic Empire style. She and Nicholas used domestic English endearments for one another such as &#x201c;lovey&#x201d; and &#x201c;wifey.&#x201d;<br><br> The Empress wanted desperately to give Russia a son, but she had four daughters before producing the Tsarevich Alex, who was soon discovered to suffer from haemophilia. This is what brought the strange figure of Rasputin into her life, since he did seem to possess some unexplained powers to stop the child bleeding&#x2014;even, in one well-attested case, through the power of a telegram, the so-called &#x201c;Spala miracle.&#x201d; As an influential presence at court, Rasputin enjoyed gifts, bribes and sexual favours. Though it was said he had shrivelled private parts, he spent days in bathhouses and brothels with prostitutes. Rumours about his behaviour widely increased the unpopularity of the royal family. Nicholas, however, would not remove him from court while the Empress continued to put her faith in him as the only healer for her son.<br><br> No visitor would have recognised that &#x201c;the moon was growing cold over the silver age.&#x201d; It was a year of extraordinary cultural ferment. Nineteen-thirteen saw the serialisation of the first parts of Andrey Bely&#x2019;s St. Petersburg, Russia&#x2019;s most significant modernist novel, and the publication of Maxim Gorky&#x2019;s celebrated autobiographical trilogy. There were three opera companies, and at the Maryinsky it was virtually impossible to get tickets when Fyodor Chaliapin was singing. On Wednesdays and Sundays there were performances of ballet, where Anna Pavlova and Vaclav Nijinsky could be seen, sometimes in the modernist choreography of Fokine. St. Petersburg enjoyed a great range of theatre, from the Imperially subsidised and traditional Alexandrinsky to the modernist experiments of Vsevolod Meyerhold. Numerous foreign films could be seen in cinemas all over St. Petersburg, while the most popular Russian film actress of the time was Vera Kholodnaya, adored in films that usually took the theme of love unrequited or humiliated.<br><br> All the avant-garde movements which were to make themselves felt in the arts took their shape between 1908 and 1913. Futurism drew on street theatre, performance poetry and bizarre costume, and was powerful in the visual arts. Whether poets used classical forms or not, they were instinctively opposed to the values of the society around them. Few of them were committed to political ways of changing that society, but Russian poets before 1913 felt that poetry might make anything happen.<br><br> Below street level on Mikhailovskaya Square, at the corner of Italyanskaya Street, lay the legendary cellar of &#x201c;The Stray Dog,&#x201d; owned by the actor Boris Pronin. To reach the Stray Dog you had to descend a narrow stone staircase and enter a doorway so low that a man had to take off his top hat. All the windows of the caf� were blocked up, as if to keep out the everyday world, and the walls and ceilings of low, curving plaster were painted with flowers and birds in brilliant colours by the artist Sergey Sudeikin. A group of bohemian artists gathered there after the theatres closed and often stayed talking until dawn. The clientele took pleasure in chilled Chablis, and anglophiles among them preferred the taste of white bulka to black Russian khleb.* It was a crowded room&#x2014;very stuffy and not always merry, a society turned in on itself, almost as if unaware of what was happening in the streets above.<br><br> In 1913,...</p><h2>Field Notes on Love</h2><p><b><b>"Utterly romantic." --Jenny Han, </b><b><i>NYT</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>The bestselling author of </b><b><i>Windfall</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight</i></b><b> returns with a meet-cute romance about Hugo and Mae, two teens who are thrown together on a cross-country train trip that will teach them about love, each other, and the futures they can build for themselves.</b></b><br><br>It's the perfect idea for a romantic week together: traveling across America by train.<br><br>But then Hugo's girlfriend dumps him.

During that time, Hugo sits with his head bent, his fingers laced behind his neck, trying to process the fact that Margaret Campbell&#x2014;�his girlfriend of nearly three years&#x2014;�is breaking up with him.<br><br> &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;ll always love you,&#x201d; she says, then adds, &#x201c;in a way.&#x201d;<br><br> Hugo winces at this. But Margaret seems determined to forge ahead.<br><br> &#x201c;The thing is,&#x201d; she says, and he lifts his head, interested to find out what&#x2014;�precisely&#x2014;�it is, this thing that&#x2019;s apparently happening. She gazes back at him with something like sympathy. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t stay with someone only out of inertia, right?&#x201d;<br><br> It&#x2019;s clear the correct answer here is &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; But Hugo can&#x2019;t bring himself to say it. He just continues to stare at her, wishing his brain weren&#x2019;t quite so muddled.<br><br> &#x201c;I know you must feel the same way,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;Things have been off between us for ages now. It&#x2019;s obvious that it&#x2019;s not working&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is it?&#x201d; Hugo asks, and Margaret gives him a weary look. But he&#x2019;s not trying to be cheeky. It&#x2019;s just that none of this seems particularly obvious to him, and his face prickles with warmth as he wonders how he managed to get it all so wrong.<br><br> &#x201c;Hugo. Come on. It&#x2019;s been hard enough when we&#x2019;re right across the road from each other. We must be barking mad to think we can do this when I&#x2019;m all the way in California and you&#x2019;re&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> She stops abruptly, and they both blink at each other.<br><br> &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he says eventually, his voice flat.<br><br> Margaret sighs. &#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s just it. Maybe if you&#x2019;d stop acting like getting a scholarship to a perfectly good uni is the worst thing that&#x2019;s ever happened to anyone in the history of&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hugo,&#x201d; she says, interrupting him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been in terrible form all summer. I&#x2019;m not the only one who&#x2019;s noticed. I realize this isn&#x2019;t what you wanted, but at some point you just have to&nbsp;. . . well, get on with it, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br> He scratches at his knee, unable to look at her. She&#x2019;s right, and they both know it, but the fact of this makes him want to crawl under the bed to avoid the rest of the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen, I get it,&#x201d; she says, playing with the end of her blond ponytail. &#x201c;If things were different, this wouldn&#x2019;t have been your first choice.&#x201d;<br><br> This is only half-�true. Hugo certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have minded trying for Oxford or Cambridge or St.&nbsp;Andrews, all of which would&#x2019;ve been options had his A levels been the only consideration. But the University of Surrey is highly regarded too. It&#x2019;s more that he never had a choice in the matter, that his path was set out for him long ago, and something about that has always made him feel like an animal at the zoo, penned in and pacing and a bit claustrophobic.<br><br> &#x201c;But if things were different,&#x201d; Margaret continues, &#x201c;you wouldn&#x2019;t have been offered the scholarship at all.&#x201d;<br><br> She says this as if it were nothing, an incidental detail, and not the very thing Hugo has been torturing himself over for years now. Because he didn&#x2019;t get a scholarship to the University of Surrey for being a brilliant essayist (which he is) or a maths genius (which he&#x2019;s not). He didn&#x2019;t get it for his skills as a pianist (though he&#x2019;s decent) or his ability on the football pitch (he&#x2019;s completely rubbish). It&#x2019;s not the result of any particular skill or talent or accomplishment.<br><br> No, Hugo got the scholarship&#x2014;�as did his five siblings&#x2014;�simply for being born.<br><br> The minute they arrived in the world&#x2014;�one after another, Hugo bringing up the rear&#x2014;�they were showered with gifts. The local market gave them a year&#x2019;s supply of formula. The pharmacy sent a truckload of free nappies. The mayor came to visit with keys to the city: six of them, one for each of England&#x2019;s fifth-�ever set of sextuplets, affectionately dubbed &#x201c;the Surrey Six.&#x201d; And a wealthy donor presented their exhausted and deeply overwhelmed parents with scholarships to the local university for each of their half-�dozen newborns.<br><br> The man&#x2014;�an eccentric billionaire who made his fortune through a chain of upscale coffee shops&#x2014;�had gotten his start at the University of Surrey, and was elated at the thought of the publicity that would one day be generated by having the sextuplets there. When he died a few years ago, he left the scholarship in the hands of the university council, and they&#x2019;ve been equally enthusiastic, making all sorts of plans for their arrival.<br><br> It&#x2019;s only Hugo who isn&#x2019;t thrilled. He knows he&#x2019;s a complete monster for being anything less than grateful. It&#x2019;s just that he hates the thought of accepting something so big simply because of the unlikely circumstances of his birth. Especially when his whole life has been about that.<br><br> &#x201c;Look, I don&#x2019;t want you to get the wrong idea,&#x201d; Margaret is saying. &#x201c;About us. About why we&#x2019;re&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not an us anymore?&#x201d;<br><br> She flinches. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve been hard on you, but I don&#x2019;t want you to think this is happening just because you&#x2019;ve been moping all summer. Or because of the distance. It&#x2019;s more that&#x2014;�well, I suppose it feels like it&#x2019;s time, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br> Hugo scrubs at his eyes, still trying to absorb all this, and when he looks up again, Margaret&#x2019;s face has softened. She moves over to sit beside him on the bed, and he automatically leans into her, their shoulders pressed together. They&#x2019;re both quiet for a moment, and he tries to focus his thoughts, which are zipping around in his head. Somewhere inside him, buried so deep he&#x2019;s never thought to examine it, is the knowledge that she&#x2019;s right about them, and his heart sinks because he&#x2019;s somehow the last to know everything, even his own feelings.</p><h2>Wake Up and Live!</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Eminently sensible and practical.&#x201d;&#x2013; <b>The New York Times Book Review</b><br><br>A true lost classic that can take your life to its fullest potential.</b> What if you were promised a simple, 8-word formula that could turn your life around? Would you believe it? Would you try it? Here it is:&nbsp;<br><i>Act as if it were impossible to fail</i><br>&nbsp;<br>This magic key is at the heart of one of the most persuasive self-improvement books ever published &#x2013; a work that, while forgotten, rivaled the popularity of contemporaneous books by Napoleon Hill and Dale Carnegie. It was called <i>Wake Up and Live!</i>, written by Dorothea Brande, an enterprising Chicago journalist.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Brande published <i>Wake Up and Live!</i> in 1936, the book soared to popularity, selling over 1,000,000 copies in years ahead. The book won so much acclaim that it became the sole work of mind-power philosophy ever to make it to the movie screen &#x2013; and as a musical, no less. In 1937, 20th Century Fox released <i>Wake Up and Live</i>, starring Walter Winchell.<br><br>Brande was a journalist and writing instructor by trade, best known for her enduring and thoughtful instructional book, <i>Becoming a Writer</i> (1934). That book, Brande explained, grew out of a period of bounding productivity in her career, which began with her discovery of one basic law of success. Brande&#x2019;s formula was so simple and magical-seeming that it made people want to argue with her the moment she uttered it. But for many it worked.<br><br><i>Act as if it were impossible to fail.</i><br><br>Brande was a preternaturally sharp-eyed student of human nature. She detected among the vast majority of men and women a &#x201c;will to fail.&#x201d; This damning wish grew from a little-seen foible of human nature. We are, Brande insisted, more frightened of suffering humiliation than desirous of achievement. When fear and ambition clash, she argued, fear inevitably prevails. &#x201c;The Unconscious dreads pain, humiliation, fatigue&#x201d; Brande wrote; &#x201c;it bends its efforts even more ceaselessly to the end of avoiding pain than it does to the procuring of positive pleasures.&#x201d;<br><br>Rather than risk rejection, people often self-sabotage: blowing deadlines, alienating allies, aimlessly procrastinating. Brande&#x2019;s grasp of the psychology of failure brought her a &#x201c;eureka&#x201d; moment. After a lifetime of searching she had found the answer.<br><br>&nbsp;<i>Act as if it were impossible to fail.</i><br><br>In <i>Wake Up and Live!</i> &#x2013; a book that is as enjoyable as its formula is simple &#x2013; Brande tells the story of her discovery and shows how her eight-word technique can be applied across different areas of life. With its observations about self-defeat, and its powerful idea for navigating around it, <i>Wake Up and Live!</i> is one of the most keenly argued and carefully observant works of practical psychology ever written.<br><br>Praise for <i>Wake Up and Live</i>!<br>&#x201c;Eminently sensible and practical.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A simple and usable technique of living...All I want to do is to buttonhole each and every one of my friends and say, &#x2018;You must read <i>Wake up and Live!</i>&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2013; Jean Starr Untermeyer<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fascinating and exactly the spring tonic that most of us need.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She made her own test with sincerity and faith, and her entire life was changed to one of overwhelming success.&#x201d; &#x2013; Earl Nightingale, <i>The Strangest Secret</i></p><p>Born in Chicago, <b>Dorothea Brande</b> (1893-1948) was a widely respected journalist, fiction writer, and writing instructor.

Full of high-rise government housing, low-income apartment complexes, and derelict single-family homes on tiny lots strewn with garbage, Ward Eight had been the second most dangerous ward in the District behind Ward Seven, but it had recently retaken the lead thanks to a triple murder in the last week of the reporting period.</p><p>But despite the late hour and the area&#x2019;s infamous reputation, a lone pedestrian ambled calmly through the misty evening, heading north on Atlantic Street SE as if he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world. He walked along a broken sidewalk, catching the glow of most all of the streetlamps that had not been shot out or burned out and left black by a city that didn&#x2019;t give a damn about its poorest residents. He wore blue jeans and a wrinkled blue blazer, his dark brown hair was tousled and damp, and a clean-shaven face revealed him as white, which, around here, at this time of night, meant he was probably up to no good.</p><p>It was ten p.m., and the neighborhood appeared devoid of any life other than the solo pedestrian. But while the street itself was barren, several sets of eyes tracked the man&#x2019;s movements. Astonished senior citizens looked out from behind their barred apartment windows. A single mother up with a sick kid watched through the bolted Plexiglas door of her duplex unit with a wince of regret, knowing good and well the damn fool in the street was going to get rolled at best and murdered at worst. And a teen with a cell phone on a darkened stoop of an apartment building watched the man carefully, reporting what he saw to an acquaintance at the other end of the connection with hopes of collecting a finder&#x2019;s fee if his friend showed up with a crew and beat every last item of value off of the hapless outsider.</p><p>But the teen and his friend were out of luck, because another group of predators were closer, and they also had their eyes on this target of opportunity.</p><p>Three dark silhouettes watched the white man from where they stood in a driveway, in front of a fifty-five-gallon drum filled with burning trash.</p><p>Marvin was the oldest of the three, and at thirty-one he had eleven priors, most for B&amp;E or armed robbery. Only two arrests had really stuck, the first one earning him eleven months, twenty-nine days in a city lockup. And then, on the inside, Marvin had bought himself a full dime at Hagerstown for manslaughter.</p><p>He did six years before being released on good behavior&#x2014;a relative term in prison&#x2014;and now he was back on the streets.</p><p>And he wasn&#x2019;t looking for work. He was looking for a score.</p><p>In this pursuit he had taken on the two young men with him. Darius and James were both sixteen, and they looked up to the older Marvin since he&#x2019;d done time and he&#x2019;d killed a man, and because of this they would follow him anywhere. For Marvin&#x2019;s part, he liked running a crew of kids because they could take chances; any convictions they earned would likely be expunged on their eighteenth birthdays.</p><p>Marvin carried a handgun in his waistband under his baggy boxers. It was a rusty Lorcin Arms L380, a piece of junk, even compared to the other pot-metal pistols ubiquitous on the low end of crime here in the &#x201c;gun-free zone&#x201d; of D.C. He&#x2019;d never shot the weapon, it was for show, really, which meant he kept the grip of the gun on display, sticking out from below his faux leather jacket, but only when the cops weren&#x2019;t around. If he saw a patrol car a couple of shakes would drop the little automatic down the inside of his warm-up pants and out onto the ground. He could then kick it away or under something, or else he could just fucking run.</p><p>Marvin had been running from trouble since long before the two boys standing with him were born.</p><p>The two kids had thin switchblades they&#x2019;d shoplifted from a head shop in Hyattsville. The knives were comically cheap novelty items, but the boys didn&#x2019;t know any better and they thought themselves impossibly badass for carrying them inside their jackets.</p><p>Darius and James fingered their knives under their clothes as they watched the white man disappear in the mist, just past an overgrown hedge strewn with blown trash. As one they turned to each other, smiling in surprise at this evening&#x2019;s outrageous fortune. The pedestrian seemed oblivious to the fact he&#x2019;d just walked past the three men standing by the fire, which made them think the fool was drunk, high, or perhaps a combination of both. Even though they rarely saw whites walking around this section of Washington Highlands at night, men and women of all races certainly drove into this neighborhood to buy drugs all the time, especially at night, and the two boys couldn&#x2019;t imagine any reason for this fool&#x2019;s presence other than a buy.</p><p>That meant he either had cash or drugs, and it didn&#x2019;t matter which, because around here, drugs were cash.</p><p>Darius and James looked back over the flames coming out of the oil drum, towards their leader.</p><p>Marvin nodded back to his crew, giving them the prompting they needed. All three left the warmth of the drum and headed down the driveway to the sidewalk, following the white man with their hands hovering inches from the weapons they kept tucked inside their clothes.</p><p>At the same instant three hunters were stalking their prey on 8th Street SE, a twenty-four-million-dollar Eurocopter streaked high over D.C., flying from Maryland in the northeast and heading towards Virginia in the southwest. The men on board discussed the chances someone below them was lining up the advanced optical sights of a man-portable surface-to-air missile on the tail rotor behind them, or perhaps tracking the nose of the helo with the iron sights of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Onboard countermeasures were ready, the pilot made defensive maneuvers, and all eyes were focused outside the helo and down at street level, scanning for the bright flare of a missile launch.</p><p>But there was no flare and there was no launch, because although the man they feared was, in fact, somewhere below them, he had no SAM, nor did he have an RPG.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even have a pistol or, for that matter, any cash.</p><p>Court Gentry walked alone through D.C.&#x2019;s most dangerous district, as aware of the footsteps closing on him as he was of the throbbing in his right forearm and the maddening itch under the plaster cast that went from his elbow to his wrist.</p><p>He knew three men were following him&#x2014;a definite leader and two subordinates, much younger and completely subservient to their boss. Gentry determined all this from a quarter-second half glance as he passed them on the driveway, as well as from the sounds of their footfalls. The man in the middle was more sure, the men on either side uneasy, slowing from time to time, then rushing to catch back up to the one in charge.</p><p>Court knew something about the psychology of crime. These street thugs weren&#x2019;t looking for a fight; they were looking for a victim. The strength of the attackers&#x2019; resolve would be reflected in how quickly they acted. If they messed around and followed him for blocks, then they would probably never go through with it. On the other hand, if they challenged him right now, that meant their confidence was high and they wouldn&#x2019;t be expecting any resistance, and this would indicate to Gentry they were probably armed and they&#x2019;d done this sort of thing before.</p><p>Just then, still half a block from the next intersection, the man in the middle of the three called out.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Yo! You know what this is. You don&#x2019;t gotta get hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>Court was pleased this guy was getting right to it. After all, he didn&#x2019;t have all night. He stopped, but he did not turn around. He just stood there, facing away. The three men behind came closer.</p><p>&#x201c;Turn around, motherfucker. Do it slow.&#x201d;</p><p>Court took a few calming breaths, but he did not turn.</p><p>&#x201c;Yo, bitch! I&#x2019;m talkin&#x2019; to you!&#x201d;</p><p>Now Court slowly pivoted to face the threat.</p><p>The three attackers stood only six feet away on the sidewalk. Court scanned their eyes. It was always the same in a threat situation. Determine the will, and determine the skill. He pegged the leader as cocky, amped up from excitement, but not from concern. The other two tried to show confidence, but their furtive eyes sold them out.</p><p>All three clutched weapons. The leader had a small gunmetal blue pistol and the two men with him&#x2014; actually now to Court they appeared to be teenagers&#x2014;each held up a knife.</p><p>Court spoke calmly. &#x201c;Evenin&#x2019;, gents.&#x201d;</p><p>The leader cocked his head in surprise. After a second, the thin black man said, &#x201c;I want that wallet. And that phone.&#x201d; He looked around on the street, then asked, &#x201c;Where your car at?&#x201d;</p><p>Court ignored the man&#x2019;s voice and focused on the pistol in his hand. &#x201c;What do you have there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gun, motherfucker!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. What kind of gun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The kinda gun that&#x2019;s gonna pop a cap in your ass if you don&#x2019;t pull out that wallet and drop it off, real nice and slow.&#x201d;</p><p>The man raised the pistol to eye level, in Court&#x2019;s face now. Even though the light was bad, Court was able to identify the weapon quickly here, just three feet from the tip of his nose.</p><p>He sighed. Disappointed. &#x201c;An L380? What the hell am I supposed to do with that piece of shit?&#x201d;</p><p>The armed man stiffened his gun arm, then smiled. &#x201c;Oh, I got it. You tryin&#x2019; to die tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Court looked around at the two others. &#x201c;Any chance you kids are strapped?&#x201d; The boys glanced at their boss, confused. After a second they held their knives up higher. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; Court looked up into the wet sky with a half smile. &#x201c;Just my luck.&#x201d;</p><p>Marvin had been pointing guns at people since before his thirteenth birthday, and in all this time he&#x2019;d never seen anyone so utterly unimpressed. Normally eyes widened to saucers and fixed on the muzzle of his weapon, and no matter what he did for the rest of the encounter, the person at gunpoint never ever glanced away from the instrument in his hand. They rarely even blinked.</p><p>But this guy turned to the other men, looked around at the street, into the sky, and at the windows of the duplexes all around. He didn&#x2019;t seem at all concerned that there was a motherfucking gat in his motherfucking face.</p><p>The white man didn&#x2019;t look high, and he didn&#x2019;t smell drunk. His languid eyes were clear, his relaxed body did not sway. For some reason he just didn&#x2019;t give a damn.</p><p>And this infuriated Marvin. He had no plan B for intimidating a victim.</p><p>The two boys stepped to either side of their prey. Now Marvin had a pistol pointed to the man&#x2019;s forehead, and his crew had stilettos in range on the left and right.</p><p>But the white man wasn&#x2019;t worried about the knives, either. He just sighed more deeply now, his shoulders slumped all the way down. &#x201c;Any chance I can persuade you guys to step off? I don&#x2019;t have any cash, no phone, no car. I don&#x2019;t have a thing to offer you but trouble, and I promise you, I&#x2019;m a lot more trouble than I&#x2019;m worth. What do you say we call it a night and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Marvin was tired of this asshole. He stepped forward a half step, raising the gun higher to drive his point home. As he did so the white man&#x2019;s left hand shot up and forward and he spun on his left foot in a blur, pirouetting his body out of the line of fire. Marvin was stunned by the movement. As the man turned, his strong hand locked onto the slide of the pistol, just aft of the muzzle, and he shoved the weapon to the side and down. Marvin instinctively pulled the trigger. The Lorcin cracked loud in the empty street, but the white man had both rotated his body away to Marvin&#x2019;s right and pushed the gun down low to Marvin&#x2019;s left just as it fired.</p><p>Marvin realized instantly he had missed.</p><p>James leapt into the air, the stiletto dropped to the ground as he grabbed at his lower leg with both hands. He fell into the grass by the sidewalk and wailed.</p><p>The kid had taken the .380 hollow-point round through the top of his foot.</p><p>Marvin knew he had fucked up, but he still had the gun in his hand, and for some inexplicable reason, his intended victim released his hold of the weapon. The man turned away from Marvin now, his attention on Darius and his blade, leaving his back exposed, just a couple of feet from Marvin&#x2019;s gun.</p><p>Marvin couldn&#x2019;t believe this fool could be so stupid as to let go of a loaded gun and then turn his back on it. Marvin raised the weapon and pointed it at the back of the fool&#x2019;s head, ready to kill the man before he did anything to Darius. He pulled the trigger.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Court ignored the asshole with the gun behind him because he knew the man was out of the fight for the next few seconds. By grabbing the slide of the weapon, Court had kept it from cycling after it fired. Now there was a spent shell inside the chamber of the Lorcin, and the dude behind him could pull that trigger all damn day and it wouldn&#x2019;t go bang, not until he racked the slide to eject the spent casing and load a fresh round from the magazine.</p><p>And Court didn&#x2019;t think for an instant he would figure this out for at least a couple of seconds. The attacker was in a fight for his life; his adrenaline would make him spastic and unable to process the flood of information coming his way.</p><p>Court had learned long ago that in any gunfight, one does not rise to the occasion. Instead, one defaults to the level of ability he has mastered.</p></p><h2>Language Arts Today, Grade 8.</h2><p>Contents: Sentences, Writing Personal Narratives, Nouns, Writing stories and much more.</p><p></p><h2>The Angel Therapy Handbook</h2><p><p><b>Doreen Virtue</b> has taught her Angel Therapy Practitioner course since 1997, helping thousands to learn the skills of spiritual healing and psychic readings in concert with the angels and archangels.

Written in plain language with many clear illustrations to explain the dynamics and techniques, Conventional Gear provides a thorough foundation of knowledge for the pilot seeking a tailwheel endorsement. It presents the combined experience of thousands of flight hours by civilian and military pilots who grew up flying airplanes with conventional gear.<br><br>The original configuration of an airplane's landing gear was tail wheel. Only during World War II did the nose wheel become common, when longer runways were required for takeoff with heavy loads. After the war, the tricycle landing gear layout became standard, but the traditional arrangement has always been known as "conventional" gear.<br><br>The tail wheel configuration is lighter, simpler and offers less drag. It is also better for rough-field operations. Therefore many crop dusters, aerobatic airplanes and ultralights are taildraggers. However, conventional gear does introduce more demands on the pilot, especially during takeoff and landing, and in strong winds. A taildragger is more difficult to operate on the ground because the center of gravity is behind the main wheels; it therefore tends to deviate from a straight path during taxi, takeoff and landing. Because taildraggers demand more piloting skill, flying one well is a sign of a good pilot.<br><br>If you want to fly a warbird, antique or a modern airplane with conventional gear, this book tells you how in a simple, clearly illustrated manner. It begins with the theory and dynamics of a tail wheel airplane, then describes the piloting techniques needed to safely fly a taildragger. The book concludes with a fascinating collection of stories about what it is like to fly some of the common and not so common airplanes with conventional gear...stories by old hands that otherwise could only be found in a good session of hangar flying.</p></p><p><b>David Robson </b>is the author of <i>Skydancing: Aerobatic Flight Techniques</i>, <i>Sunrise to Sunset: Night Flight Techniques</i>, and <i>Transition to Twins: Your First Multi-Engine Rating</i>.</p><h2>The Sword of the Spirit The Word of God (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>The Sword of the Spirit The Word of God is a powerful handbook for praying the Word of God in specific situations. &#34;Thank you Lord that You will grant that Your bond servants will speak Your Word with all confidence, while You will extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders will take place through the name of Your holy son Jesus.&#34; Acts 4:29-30</p><p>"The Lord's anointing on this book of scriptural prayers is amazing!" -- <i>Mac Holley, reader</i><br><br>"The Sword of the Spirit is a powerful handbook for praying the words of Holy Scripture in specific situations." -- <i>Francis S.

It begins with simple colour theory and a colour wheel, with a template provided so that readers can paint their own; a vital step towards understanding colour. There is vividly illustrated guidance on complementary, warm and cool colours, colour tone, using a limited palette, dull and bright colours and factoring in local colour. There follows an array of essential colour mixes using widely available Winsor &amp; Newton colours. A beautifully presented and practical guide to understanding and mixing colours. Watercolour artists from beginners to more experienced painters will find this a handy, comprehensive guide.</p><p>Julie Collins studied Fine Art at the University of Reading and has been an artist, writer and teacher since then. She has written colour mixing and artist&#39;s problem solving books and writes for The Artist magazine. She works from her studio in Farnham, Surrey, where she explores her passion for painting, drawing and crafts.Mix exactly the right color first time without wasting paint with this handy book. The same size as the Twenty to Make series (i.e., pocket sized), this new range of paint mixing books is sure to be a hit with all budding artists. All beginner watercolor artists would find this book useful I think. To start with it contains a useful guide to the materials you need to buy, and more importantly those you don&#39;t. At last, a book that realizes student quality paint is good enough beginners, the market at which the paint is aimed-hooray! Also, you can find out what paintbrushes and paper to get and why; this is not a book that advocates wasting money. There is a practical color wheel exercise to try, a guide to buying colors and also to mixing thirteen useful ones. Color theory is not as easy as it sounds, and often it ends up being just that --theory rather than practical application. I have always struggled with it myself, so appreciated the exercises and notes, such as why a certain color is used rather than another and what you need it for. All the usual aspects of color theory are here such as complimentary colors, warm and cool colors, primary/secondary/tertiary, achieving depth, etc. Each is laid out briefly with examples and then it is up to the student to complete the simple exercises and discover what it is all about. The final part of the book shows how to mix colors and what you get, a useful range of shades for pretty much any kind of painting and how to do it. There is a helpful one page glossary at the back, and all this in fewer than fifty pages is admirable, to say the least. I always think that any practical subject like art is more about doing than reading about doing and this book bears this out.

Great colour charts, good for beginners. http://www.yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * I particularly like Julie Collins&#39; book because it takes you right back to the beginning with a very simple approach. It deals with watercolour paints but actually, it doesn&#39;t really matter about the medium when you are getting started.I took this book on holiday as it is small, light and doesn&#39;t take up too much room. I didn&#39;t use the paints and colours that were set out here but instead, took some Koh-i-noor Dye paints and the Koh-i-Noor Watercolour Wheel. I felt that I could find basic colours on which to start my education in these sets. The colours used in the book are of a limited palette, taking the viewpoint that if you have red, blue and yellow, you can make an infinite number of colours. There are 4-5 of each colour and these are used to demonstrate different colour combinations. You cover primary, secondary, tertiary and complementary colours and then look at colour mixes of different combinations of colour. Using the book with the specific colours listed, you have around 400 variations. The swatches are immensely useful for a particular colour you like as you have a vast visual library for finding and creating a similar colour with the materials you have. I felt that it gave me a great practical grounding for moving onto more adventures in colour and I think that it would be a good book for anyone to have if you are looking at dyeing fabric or paper and don&#39;t know where to start. * Workshop on the Web * November 2015 Far too many books overcomplicate the issue and include pages of nearly identical swatches that leave you confused. The introduction includes a still life that was painted using three colours, despite being full of tints and hues. The caption explains the mix for each section, with percentages. It&#39;s typical of the approach throughout. Julie uses only 13 colours, divided between reds, yellows, and blues. After a quick exercise painting a colour wheel, you&#39;ll move on to an explanation of primary, secondary and tertiary colours. A piece on complementaries is followed by an explanation of warm and cool and demonstration of how to create depth. This is basic stuff, but so excellently explained that even the expert might want to take a look. * The Artist *</p><h2>History of Art: A survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day</h2><p>Added to this new edition are more than 40 concise discussions of cultural developments paralleling movements in art, from ancient Greek times through our own Postmodern era.

Two-time Academy Award Screenwriter William Goldman gives &#34;The Big Picture&#34; on Hollywood, Screenwriting, and the future of American Cinema. Among the essays: Who Killed Hollywood? * Christmas in July * Pushing the Envelope * City of Angels * Anything but Gump * and more.</p><p>"The trouble with the Oscar show is that it's too short," William Goldman writes more than once in these infectiously droll essays about Hollywood stars, box office roulette, vintage movie years, and the illogic of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. Any other writer would be in deep ironical mode saying that, but the great screenwriter (<i>All the President's Men</i>, <i>The Princess Bride</i>) and giddy movie enthusiast is hardly a "prevailing view" kind of guy. Wouldn't we have gotten Brando himself at the 1973 Oscars, he argues, if he had unlimited time to defend Indian rights to a billion viewers? Would <i>anything</i> have been better than that? Writing irregularly for <i>New York</i> magazine between 1991 and 1999, Goldman promised to explain "the Hollywood mind" to the rest of us--with the mantra always in front of him that "nobody knows anything." Which leaves him open to occasional free association. <i>Gungha Din</i> is "the most important movie ever made," he writes not once but twice. If Miramax is successful it's because the Weinsteins "live above the store." What do you do with Universal giving Sylvester Stallone $60 million after thirteen duds like <i>Tango and Cash</i>? "How long do you think you'd hold if you had those thirteen movies played over and over in a locked room?" Goldman asks. But while there's ephemera galore here, and nothing so very lofty, the guy speed-typing his interior monologues <i>loves</i> movies, and when he runs through the dumb things in <i>Good Will Hunting</i> or the great things about (his "all-time favorite") Cary Grant, just try putting the book down. <i>--Lyall Bush</i>The title of Goldman's newest collection of essays is deceptive. Unlike his expansive reflections in Adventures in the Screen Trade, these selections (most of which originally appeared in Premiere, the New York Daily News and New York magazine) narrowly focus on Goldman's once timely film reviews and his commentaries on the 1990-1999 Academy Awards. With two screenwriting Oscars under his belt (for Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men), Goldman is a knowledgeable Hollywood tour guide. On the rare occasions when his predictions are off-target, he's still entertaining. However, this slight and somewhat repetitive collection could have benefited from annotations to make it more accessible to Hollywood outsiders who might be wondering which film finally won the Oscar and how much those projected hits ultimately grossed. Most pleasurable are Goldman's assured opinions ("Giving the Best ActorAactor is the word folksAto Roberto Benigni for his mugging in Life Is Beautiful is, for me, a sin, a disgrace and removes forever the argument from those who felt DeMille's Greatest Show on Earth was the worst Oscar winner ever.") and his contrarianisms ("The trouble with the Oscar show is that it is too short."). Goldman hits his stride with "You Go, Girls!," taking on executives who delude themselves into thinking that every successful movie about women is a fluke, and the "The Emperor's New Fatigues," which lambastes Saving Private Ryan. (Nov.) FYI: Goldman's royalties from this book will be donated to the Motion Picture and Television Fund. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Enochian Physics: The Structure of the Magical Universe</h2><p>An explanation of magick as applied to physical phenomena and their Western scientific interpretation.

The award-winning first volume, <em>Old Testament Theology: Israel's Gospel,</em> followed the story line of the First Testament, developing its narrative theology. This volume finds its point of departure in the Prophets, Psalms and Wisdom literature, where we encounter a more discursive thinking that is closer to traditional theology. Whereas the first volume followed the epochal divine acts of Israel's "gospel" narrative, here Goldingay sets out the faith of Israel under the major rubrics of God Israel The Nightmare The Vision The World The Nations Humanity In a style that cleaves closely to the text, Goldingay offers up a masterful exposition of the faith of the First Testament, one born of living long with the text and the refined skill of asking interesting questions and listening with trained attention. Never one to sacrifice a close hearing of a text for an easy generality, or to mute a discordant note for the sake of reassuring harmony, Goldingay gives us an Old Testament theology shot through with the edge-of-the-seat vitality of discovery. The first volume of <em>Old Testament Theology</em> has triggered lively discussion in the academy. This volume too will be welcomed and discussed by scholars. But its fresh presentations of theological motifs, as well as its engagement with contemporary contexts, will also greatly enrich the treasury of insights this series makes available to preachers and communicators of the Old Testament.</p><p>Features &amp; Benefits *The climax of a foremost interpreter of the Old Testament that is sure to be consulted and discussed for years to come *Gives full treatment of the major themes of Old Testament faith *Numerous insights born of mature scholarship *An abundance of fresh discussions of theological motifs *A goldmine for preachers and communicators of the Old TestamentJohn Goldingay (PhD, University of Nottingham; DD, Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth) is David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary. He was previously principal and a professor of Old Testament and Hebrew at St John&#x2019;s Theological College in Nottingham, England. His books include <em>An Introduction to the Old Testament</em>, <em>The Theology of the Book of Isaiah</em>, <em>Key Questions about Interpretation</em>, <em>Do We Need the New Testament?</em> and commentaries on Psalms, Isaiah, and Daniel. He has also authored the three-volume <em>Old Testament Theology</em> and the seventeen-volume Old Testament For Everyone series. Goldingay also serves in pastoral ministry as an associate pastor at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, Pasadena. He holds membership in the Society of Biblical Literature and the Society for Old Testament Study, and serves on the Task Force on Biblical Interpretation in the Anglican Communion and the editorial board for the Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies.</p><h2>Downbelow Station (20th Anniversary) (Alliance-Union Universe)</h2><p><b>The Hugo Award-winning classic sci-fi novel about interstellar war.</b><br><br>The Beyond started with the Stations orbiting the stars nearest Earth. The Great Circle the interstellar freighters traveled was long, but not unmanageable, and the early Stations were emotionally and politically dependent on Mother Earth. The Earth Company which ran this immense operation reaped incalculable profits and influenced the affairs of nations.<br><br>Then came Pell, the first station centered around a newly discovered living planet. The discovery of Pell's World forever altered the power balance of the Beyond. Earth was no longer the anchor which kept this vast empire from coming adrift, the one living mote in a sterile universe.<br><br>But Pell was just the first living planet. Then came Cyteen, and later others, and a new and frighteningly different society grew in the farther reaches of space. The importance of Earth faded and the Company reaped ever smaller profits as the economic focus of space turned outward. But the powerful Earth Fleet was sitll a presence in the Beyond, and Pell Station was to become the last stronghold in a titanic struggle between the vast, dynamic forces of the rebel Union and those who defended Earth's last, desperate grasp for the stars.</p><p><b>C.

Are they indeed, as they claim, a lost biblical Jewish tribe directly descended from the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon? Or are they impostors, claiming to be Jewish merely to expedite a modern-day exodus to Israel, following a path undertaken by the Ethiopian Falasha Jews?<br>These are the questions that noted historian Tudor Parfitt tackles in this absorbing narrative, Journey to the Vanished City. Tracing the origins of these self-proclaimed black Jews in compelling whodunit fashion, Parfitt searches for the fabled city of Sena, from which the Lemba claim to have come centuries before. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this is not merely an expedition through uncharted African territory, for the book takes on the aura of an epic journey through the terrain of myth. Along the way, the reader encounters fascinating stories of the Queen of Sheba, of long-lost Jewish kingdoms, of King Solomon's mines, and of Ophir, the legendary biblical land of gold.<br>A compelling travel narrative in the best tradition of Paul Theroux and John McPhee, this is a work that through its controversial thesis is bound to generate public debate. Journey to the Vanished City opens up a new and exciting chapter in Jewish history.</p><p>A unique blend of academic research and personal exploration, biblical (Old Testament) accounts, living oral histories, and South African history have resulted in this fascinating story of the author's search for the Lemba, a lost tribe of Israel, and their original city of Sena. There is no doubt that the Lemba exist. They are descended from Baramina, the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Physically, they resemble Europeans and Egyptians, and they practice the biblical form of Judaism. Supposedly part of the Ethiopian Falashas, they migrated to South Africa, where a new Sena was erected along the Zimbabwe River in Mozambique. Written for general readers, this account of new developments in religious and South African history will also interest historians and scholars in the field. It is only the beginning of an incredible ethnological search. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Ann E. Cohen, Rochester P.

It ushered in the modern biography and raised the genre to the level of high literary art. Strachey approached his subjects with scepticism rather than reverence, and his iconoclastic wit and engaging narratives thrilled as well as shocked his contemporaries.

He also looks at Black West Coast businessmen who helped found British Columbia, particularly Victoria, and Black settlement in the prairie provinces. Throughout Winks explores efforts by African-Canadians to establish and maintain meaningful lifestyles in Canada. The Blacks in Canada investigates the French and English periods of slavery, the abolitionist movement in Canada, and the role played by Canadians in the broader continental antislavery crusade, as well as Canadian adaptations to nineteenth- and twentieth-century racial mores.

"Never have I seen my crystal ball so filled with darkness."<br><br>She cupped her hands around the thing, as if to shield my eyes from the horrors that were swimming in its murky depths. As her fingers gripped the glass, I thought I could feel ice water trickling down inside my gullet.<br><br>At the edge of the table, a thin candle flickered, its sickly light glancing off the dangling brass hoops of the Gypsy's earrings, then flying off to die somewhere in the darkened corners of the tent.<br><br>Black hair, black eyes, black dress, red-painted cheeks, red mouth, and a voice that could only have come from smoking half a million cigarettes.<br><br>As if to confirm my suspicions, the old woman was suddenly gripped by a fit of violent coughing that rattled her crooked frame and left her gasping horribly for air. It sounded as though a large bird had somehow become entangled in her lungs and was flapping to escape.<br><br>"Are you all right?" I asked. "I'll go for help."<br><br>I thought I had seen Dr. Darby in the churchyard not ten minutes earlier, pausing to have a word or two at each stall of the church f�te. But before I could make a move, the Gypsy's dusky hand had covered mine on the black velvet of the tabletop.<br><br>"No," she said. "No . . . don't do that. It happens all the time."<br><br>And she began to cough again.<br><br>I waited it out patiently, almost afraid to move.<br><br>"How old are you?" she said at last. "Ten? Twelve?"<br><br>"Eleven," I said, and she nodded her head wearily as though she'd known it all along.<br><br>"I see--a mountain," she went on, almost strangling on the words, "and the face--of the woman you will become."<br><br>In spite of the stifling heat of the darkened tent, my blood ran cold. She was seeing Harriet, of course!<br><br>Harriet was my mother, who had died in a climbing accident when I was a baby.<br><br>The Gypsy turned my hand over and dug her thumb painfully into the very center of my palm. My fingers spread--and then curled in upon themselves like the toes of a chicken's severed foot.<br><br>She took up my left hand. "This is the hand you were born with," she said, barely glancing at the palm, then letting it fall and picking up the other. ". . . and this is the hand you've grown."<br><br>She stared at it distastefully as the candle flickered. "This broken star on your Mount of Luna shows a brilliant mind turned in upon itself--a mind that wanders the roads of darkness."<br><br>This was not what I wanted to hear.<br><br>"Tell me about the woman you saw on the mountain," I said. "The one I shall become."<br><br>She coughed again, clutching her colored shawl tightly about her shoulders, as though wrapping herself against some ancient and invisible winter wind.<br><br>"Cross my palm with silver," she demanded, sticking out a grubby hand.<br><br>"But I gave you a shilling," I said. "That's what it says on the board outside."<br><br>"Messages from the Third Circle cost extra," she wheezed. "They drain the batteries of my soul."<br><br>I almost laughed out loud. Who did this old hag think she was? But still, she seemed to have spotted Harriet beyond the veil, and I couldn't let skepticism spoil even half a chance of having a few words with my dead mother.<br><br>I dug for my last shilling, and as I pressed the coin into her hand, the Gypsy's dark eyes, suddenly as bright as a jackdaw's, met mine.<br><br>"She is trying to come home," she said. "This . . . woman . . . is trying to come home from the cold. She wants you to help her."<br><br>I leapt to my feet, bashing the bottom of the table with my bare knees. It teetered, then toppled to one side as the candle slid off and fell among a tangle of dusty black hangings.<br><br>At first there was a little wisp of black smoke as the flame turned blue, then red, then quickly orange. I looked on in horror as it spread along the drapery.<br><br>In less time than it takes to tell, the entire tent was in flames.<br><br>I wish I'd had the presence of mind to throw a wet cloth over the Gypsy's eyes and lead her to safety, but instead I bolted--straight through the circle of fire that was the entranceway--and I didn't stop until I reached the coconut pitch, where I stood panting behind a canvas drape, trying to catch my breath.<br><br>Someone had brought a wind-up gramophone to the churchyard, from which the voice of Danny Kaye was issuing, made nauseously tinny by the throat of the machine's painted horn:<br><br>"Oh I've got a lov-ely bunch of coconuts.<br><br>There they are a-standin' in a row . . ."<br>I looked back at the Gypsy's tent just in time to see Mr. Haskins, St. Tancred's sexton, and another man whom I didn't recognize heave a tub of water, apples and all, onto the flames.<br><br>Half the villagers of Bishop's Lacey, or so it seemed, stood gaping at the rising column of black smoke, hands over mouths or fingertips to cheeks, and not a single one of them knowing what to do.<br><br>Dr. Darby was already leading the Gypsy slowly away towards the St. John's Ambulance tent, her ancient frame wracked with coughing. How small she seemed in the sunlight, I thought, and how pale.<br><br>"Oh, there you are, you odious little prawn. We've been looking for you everywhere."<br><br>It was Ophelia, the older of my two sisters. Feely was seventeen, and ranked herself right up there with the Blessed Virgin Mary, although the chief difference between them, I'm willing to bet, is that the BVM doesn't spend twenty-three hours a day peering at herself in a looking glass while picking away at her face with a pair of tweezers.<br><br>With Feely, it was always best to employ the rapid retort: "How dare you call me a prawn, you stupid sausage? Father's told you more than once it's disrespectful."<br><br>Feely made a snatch at my ear, but I sidestepped her easily. By sheer necessity, the lightning dodge had become one of my specialties.<br><br>"Where's Daffy?" I asked, hoping to divert her venomous attention.<br><br>Daffy was my other sister, two years older than me, and at thirteen already an accomplished co-torturer.<br><br>"Drooling over the books. Where else?" She pointed with her chin to a horseshoe of trestle tables on the churchyard grass, upon which the St. Tancred's Altar Guild and the Women's Institute had joined forces to set up a jumble sale of secondhand books and assorted household rubbish.<br><br>Feely had seemed not to notice the smoking remnants of the Gypsy's tent. As always, she had left her spectacles at home out of vanity, but her inattentiveness might simply have been lack of interest. For all practical purposes, Feely's enthusiasms stopped where her skin ended.<br><br>"Look at these," she said, holding a set of black earrings up to her ears. She couldn't resist showing off. "French jet. They came from Lady Trotter's estate. Glenda says they were quite fortunate to get a tanner for them."<br><br>"Glenda's right," I said. "French jet is nothing but glass."<br><br>It was true: I had recently melted down a ghastly Victorian brooch in my chemical laboratory, and found it to be completely silicaceous. It was unlikely that Feely would ever miss the thing.<br><br>"English jet is so much more interesting," I said. "It's formed from the fossilized remains of monkey-puzzle trees, you see, and--"<br><br>But Feely was already walking away, lured by the sight of Ned Cropper, the ginger-haired potboy at the Thirteen Drakes who, with a certain muscular grace, was energetically tossing wooden batons at the Aunt Sally. His third stick broke the wooden figure's clay pipe clean in two, and Feely pulled up at his side just in time to be handed the teddy bear prize by the madly blushing Ned.<br><br>"Anything worth saving from the bonfire?" I asked Daffy, who had her nose firmly stuck in what, judging by its spotty oxidized pages, might have been a first edition of Pride and Prejudice.<br><br>It seemed unlikely, though. Whole libraries had been turned in for salvage during the war, and nowadays there wasn't much left for the jumble sales. Whatever books remained unsold at the end of the summer season would, on Guy Fawkes Night, be carted from the basement of the parish hall, heaped up on the village green, and put to the torch.<br><br>I tipped my head sideways and took a quick squint at the stack of books Daffy had already set aside: On Sledge and Horseback to Outcast Siberian Lepers, Pliny's Natural History, The Martyrdom of Man, and the first two volumes of the Memoirs of Jacques Casanova--the most awful piffle. Except perhaps for Pliny, who had written some ripping stuff about poisons.<br><br>I walked slowly along the table, running a finger across the books, all of them arranged with their spines upwards: Ethel M. Dell, E. M. Delafield, Warwick Deeping . . .<br><br>I had noticed on another occasion that most of the great poisoners in history had names beginning with the letter C, and now here were all of these authors beginning with a D. Was I on to something? Some secret of the universe?<br><br>I squeezed my eyes shut and concentrated: Dickens . . . Doyle . . . Dumas . . . Dostoyevsky--I had seen all of them, at one time or another, clutched in Daffy's hands.<br><br>Daffy herself was planning to become a novelist when she was older. With a name like Daphne de Luce, she couldn't fail if she tried!<br><br>"Daff!" I said. "You'll never guess--"<br><br>"Quiet!" she snapped. "I've told you not to speak to me when I'm reading."<br><br>My sister could be a most unpleasant porpoise when she felt like it.<br><br>It had not always been this way. When I was younger, for instance, and Father had recruited Daffy to hear my bedtime prayers, she had taught me to recite them in Pig Latin, and we had rolled among the down-filled pillows, laughing until we nearly split.<br><br>"Od-gay ess-blay Ather-fay, Eely-fay, and Issis-may Ullet-may. And Ogger-day, oo-tay!"<br><br>But over the years, something had changed between my sisters and me.<br><br>A little hurt, I reached for a volume that lay on top of the others: A Looking Glasse, for London and Englande.

The breathtaking and captivating illustrations by Joel Specter help bring to life the timeless story of Easter in He Is Alive! Well-known children&#x2019;s author, Helen Haidle, lays out in order all the events of the passion and resurrection of Christ in a way that is easy for children 6 and under to understand. He Is Alive! extends beyond the story of the cross and encourages children to develop a deeper understanding of the truth that Jesus is alive. Not only is Jesus alive, he lives in us and because of this, we can live victoriously.</p><p>Helen Haidle is an award-winning author of more than 30 children&#x2019;s books including What Would Jesus Do?, What Did Jesus Promise?, and He is Alive. She lives in Sisters, Oregon, with her husband David.The meatiest of the Easter titles reviewed here, this volume offers the most faithful retelling of the Easter story. Haidle (The First Christmas Tree) begins her account with Jesus' raising of Lazarus, a foreshadowing of his own rise from the dead but also an act that ignites the ire and jealousy of other priests and teachers. The author then turns to the key events of Holy Week, beginning with Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem (Palm Sunday) to celebrate Passover and his overturning of the money changers' tables in the Temple on Monday. Spector (A Garden's Promise) contributes a dramatic painting depicting the betrayal of Christ, as money drops into Judas's open hands. All of the pivotal moments appear here, from Pilate's reluctance to crucify Christ to Christ's rising from the dead. Spector keeps the focus on the drama at hand and, except for a few inconsistent renderings of Christ's face, his portraits are accomplished. Haidle continues the action with stories related in Luke and John about Christ's appearance to Mary Magdalene and Mary, wife of Cleophas, as well as to the disciples. (Adults should note that biblical references for these events are not given.) The only drawback is the addition of the "He Is Alive!" refrain on the last four spreads; the repetition seems unnecessary and forced in an otherwise accessible narrative.

It will live as the most enchanting ornament of all the Freudian biographical literature."&#x2015;Ernest Jones</strong></p> Bringing together &#x201c;Writing on the Wall,&#x201d; composed some ten years after H.D&#x2019;s stay in Vienna, and &#x201c;Advent,&#x201d; a journal she kept at the time of her analysis there, <em>Tribute to Freud</em> offers a rare glimpse into the consulting room of the father of psychoanalysis. It may also be the most intimate of H.D.&#x2019;s works.<br><br> Compelled by historical as well as personal crises, the poet worked with Freud during 1933-34. The streets of Vienna were littered with tokens dropped like confetti on the city, stating "Hitler gives work." "Hitler gives bread." Having endured World War I, she was now gathering her resources to face the second cataclysm she knew was approaching. In analysis, Hilda Doolittle explored her Pennsylvania childhood, her relationship with Ezra Pound (inventory of her nom de plume H.D.), Havelock Ellis, D.H. Lawrence, her ex-husband Richard Aldington, and subsequent companion Winifred Ellerman ("Bryher"), as well as her own creative processes.<br><br> Freud, regarding H.D. as a student as well as a patient, wads hardly the detached presence one might imagine. Revealed here in the poet's words and in his own letters, which comprise an appendix, is the considerate friend, the charming Viennese gentleman&#x2015;art collector, dog lover, wit&#x2015;and the pioneer, always revising his ideas and possessed of an insight that could be terrifying in its force.</p><p>H.D. (1886-1961) (the pen name of Hilda Doolittle) was born in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, PA in 1886. A major twentieth century poet with &#x201c;an ear more subtle than Pound&#x2019;s, Moore&#x2019;s, or Yeats&#x2019;s&#x201d; as Marie Ponsot writes, she was the author of several volumes of poetry, fiction, essays, and memoirs. She is perhaps one of the best-known and prolific women poets of the Modernist era. Bryher Ellerman was a novelist and H.D.&#x2019;s wealthy companion. She financed H.D.&#x2019;s therapy with Freud.A warm and revealing portrait of H.D.&#x2019;s mentor and friend. &#x2014; Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br>The book, with its appropriate title, is surely the most delightful and precious appreciation of Freud&#x2019;s personality ever likely to be written. Only a fine creative artist could have written it...I can only say that I envy anyone who has not read it, and that it will live as the most enchanting ornament of all the Freudian biographical literature. &#x2014; Ernest Jones, Author of The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud</p><h2>10</h2><p><p>A sensationally attractive package (chunky and substantial, with a bright red slipcase and cover) sets the stage for an inventive exploration of counting&#x2015;from one to ten and back again, simultaneously.

He lives in Sydney, Australia.<b>1</b><br>It was Graham Greene who said a story has no beginning or end. The author simply chooses a moment, an arbitrary point, and looks either forward or back. That moment is now&#x2014;an October morning&#x2014;when the clang of a metallic letter flap heralds the first post.<br><br>There is an envelope on the mat inside my front door. Inside is a small stiff rectangle of paper that says nothing and everything.<br><b>Dear Ali,<br>I</b>&#x2019;<b>m in trouble. I must see you. Please come to the reunion.<br>Love, Cate</b><br>Sixteen words. Long enough to be a suicide note. Short enough to end an affair. I don&#x2019;t know why Cate has written to me now. She hates me. She told me so the last time we spoke, eight years ago. The past. Given long enough I could tell you the month, the day and the hour but these details are unimportant.<br><br>All you need to know is the year&#x2014;1998. It should have been the summer we finished university; the summer we went backpacking across Europe; the summer I lost my virginity to Brian Rusconi and not to Cate&#x2019;s father. Instead it was the summer she went away and the summer I left home&#x2014;a summer not big enough for everything that happened.<br><br>Now she wants to see me again. Sometimes you know when a story begins...<br><b>2</b><br>When the day comes that I am asked to recalibrate the calendar, I am going to lop a week off January and February and add them to October, which deserves to be forty days long, maybe more.<br><br>I love this time of year. The tourists have long gone and the kids are back at school. The TV schedules aren&#x2019;t full of reruns and I can sleep under a duvet again. Mostly I love the sparkle in the air, without the pollen from the plane trees so I can open my lungs and run freely.<br><br>I run every morning&#x2014;three circuits of Victoria Park in Bethnal Green, each one of them more than a mile. Right now I&#x2019;m just passing Durward Street in Whitechapel. Jack the Ripper territory. I once took a Ripper walking tour, a pub crawl with ghost stories. The victim I remember best was his last one, Mary Kelly, who died on the same date as my birthday, November the ninth.<br><br>People forget how small an area Jack roamed. Spitalfields, Shoreditch and Whitechapel cover less than a square mile, yet in 1888 more than a million people were crammed into slums, without decent water and sewerage. It is still overcrowded and poor but that's only compared to places like Hampstead or Chiswick or Holland Park. Poverty is a relative state in a rich country where the wealthiest are the first to cry poor.<br><br>It is seven years since I last ran competitively, on a September night in Birmingham, under lights. I wanted to get to the Sydney Olympics but only two of us were going to make it. Four&#x2013;hundredths of a second separated first from fifth; half a meter, a heartbeat, a broken heart.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t run to win anymore. I run because I can and because I'm fast. Fast enough to blur at the edges. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here now, flirting with the ground while perspiration leaks between my breasts, plastering my T&#x2013;shirt to my stomach.<br><br>When I run my thoughts become clearer, or at least concentrated. Mostly I think about work and imagine that today someone will call and offer me my old job back.<br><br>A year ago I helped solve a kidnapping and find a missing girl. One of the kidnappers dropped me onto a wall, crushing my spine. After six operations and nine months of physiotherapy I am fit again, with more steel in my spine than England&#x2019;s back four. Unfortunately, nobody seems to know what to do with me at the Metropolitan Police. I am a wonky wheel on the machine.<br><br>As I pass the playground, I notice a man sitting on a bench reading a newspaper. There is no child on the climbing frame behind him and other benches are in sunshine. Why has he chosen the shade?<br><br>In his mid&#x2013;thirties, dressed in a shirt and tie, he doesn't raise his eyes as I pass. He&#x2019;s studying a crossword. What sort of man does a crossword in a park at this hour of the morning? A man who can't sleep. A man who waits.<br><br>Up until a year ago I used to watch people for a living. I guarded diplomats and visiting heads of state, ferrying their wives on shopping trips to Harrods and dropping their children at school. It is probably the most boring job in the Metropolitan Police but I was good at it. During five years with the Diplomatic Protection Group I didn't fire a shot in anger or miss one of the wives' hair appointments. I was like one of those soldiers who sit in the missile silos, praying the phone never rings.<br><br>On my second circuit of the park he is still there. His suede jacket is lying across his lap. He has freckles and smooth brown hair, cut symmetrically and parted to the left. A leather briefcase is tucked close to his side.<br><br>A gust of wind tears the newspaper from his fingers. Three steps and I reach it first. It wraps around my thigh.<br><br>For a moment he wants to retreat, as if he's too close to the edge. His freckles make him look younger. His eyes don't meet mine. Instead he bunches his shoulders shyly and says thank you. The front page is still wrapped around my thigh. For a moment I'm tempted to have some fun. I could make a joke about feeling like tomorrow&#x2019;s fish&#x2013;and&#x2013;chips.<br><br>The breeze feels cool on my neck. &#x201c;Sorry, I&#x2019;m rather sweaty.&#x201d;<br><br>He touches his nose nervously, nods and touches his nose again.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you run every day?&#x201d; he asks suddenly.<br><br>&#x201c;I try to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How far?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four miles.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s an American accent. He doesn&#x2019;t know what else to say.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to keep going. I don&#x2019;t want to cool down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Sure. Have a nice day.&#x201d; It doesn&#x2019;t sound so trite coming from an American.<br><br>On my third circuit of the park the bench is empty. I look for him along the street but there are no silhouettes. Normal service has been resumed.<br><br>Farther along the street, just visible on the corner, a van is parked at the curb. As I draw nearer, I notice a white plastic tent over missing paving stones. A metal cage is propped open around the hole. They&#x2019;ve started work early.<br><br>I do this sort of thing&#x2014;take note of people and vehicles. I look for things that are out of the ordinary; people in the wrong place, or the wrong clothes; cars parked illegally; the same face in different locations. I can&#x2019;t change what I am.<br><br>Unlacing my trainers, I pull a key from beneath the insole and unlock my front door. My neighbor, Mr. Mordecai, waves from his window. I once asked him his first name and he said it should be Yo&#x2019;man.<br><br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that's what my boys call me: &#x2018;Yo man, can I have some money?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yo man, can I borrow the car?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>His laugh sounded like nuts falling on a roof.<br><br>In the kitchen I pour myself a large glass of water and drink it greedily. Then I stretch my quads, balancing one leg on the back of a chair.<br><br>The mouse living under my fridge chooses that moment to appear. It is a very ambivalent mouse, scarcely bothering to lift its head to acknowledge me. And it doesn't seem to mind that my youngest brother, Hari, keeps setting mousetraps. Perhaps it knows that I disarm them, taking off the cheese when Hari isn't around.<br><br>The mouse finally looks up at me, as though about to complain about the lack of crumbs. Then it sniffs the air and scampers away.<br><br>Hari appears in the doorway, bare-chested and barefooted. Opening the fridge, he takes out a carton of orange juice and unscrews the plastic lid. He looks at me, considers his options, and gets a glass from the cupboard. Sometimes I think he is prettier than I am. He has longer lashes and thicker hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you going to the reunion tonight?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me <i>you're</i> going! You said you wouldn&#x2019;t be caught dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I changed my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>There is a voice from upstairs. &#x201c;Hey, have you seen my knickers?&#x201d;<br><br>Hari looks at me sheepishly.<br><br>&#x201c;I know I had a pair. They&#x2019;re not on the floor.&#x201d;<br><br>Hari whispers, &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d gone out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I went for a run. Who is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An old friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you must know her name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cheryl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cheryl Taylor!&#x201d; (She&#x2019;s a bottle blonde who works behind the bar at the White Horse). &#x201c;She&#x2019;s older than I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, she's not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth do you see in her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What difference does that make?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m interested.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, she has assets.&#x201d;<br><br>"Assets?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The best.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about Phoebe Griggs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too small.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Emma Shipley?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Saggy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very funny.&#x201d;<br><br>Cheryl is coming down the stairs.

The impact of this extraordinary child on Fynn, his friends and the people in their neighbourhood was to be immense. Nobody who met Anna could remain the same: this intelligent, lively, precocious chatterbox had an outlook on life which completely undercut adult pretensions and illusions. Anna&#39;s influence continues today.

An overzealous prosecutor bent on winning relied on flimsy circumstantial evidence and Dennis was convicted and sentenced to life in prison while his co-defendant, Ronnie Williamson was sentenced to death. After twelve years of incarceration, with the help of Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project, and DNA testing, Dennis and Ronnie were exonerated and the real killer is found guilty. On April 15, 1999, Dennis and Ronnie walk free from prison. <p>"The story of the unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction of Dennis Fritz is compelling and fascinating. After serving eleven years for a murder he did not commit, Dennis was exonerated and had the strength and courage to put his life back together." &#x2014;John Grisham </p><p>"As I write these words, there have been one hundred eighty-one post-conviction DNA exonerations in America. The exonerated, many crime victims and their families (including the Carter family from the Fri and Williamson case) are the heart and soul of this movement. In this unique and brave community of survivors, there is no more decent and dignified a man, nor a more gentle soul, than Dennis Fritz. For eight years he has unstintingly supported our work in every way possible, re-living what are often very painful memories in service to a just cause. And now he has had the fortitude to tell his whole story. As always, I am in awe of his courage and humbled by his efforts." &#x2014;Barry C. Scheck Co-Director The Innocence Project. Journey Toward Justice is the one and only companion book to John Grisham's, The Innocent Man. After having read Mr. Fritz's book, John gave his full and heart felt endorsement, stating that it was most compelling and fancinating. Futher, John stated that Dennis had the strength and courage to put his life back together after having served 11 years for a murder he did not commit.</p></p><p>Before his conviction, Dennis Fritz taught middle school science and coached football, basketball and track. Since his release, Dennis has been enjoying his freedom to the fullest He is a spokesman for the Innocence Project at fundraising events and works first hand with inmates. He serves as a board member of the Coalition to Demolish the Death Penalty, and the Midwestern Innocence Project.In April 1999, Fritz walked out of court a free man after spending 11 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. He maintained his innocence from day one against the pressure of detectives, prosecutors, the judge, and the jury. The tide began to turn after Barry Scheck's Innocence Project took on his case. While the blow-by-blow descriptions of Fritz's arrest, hearing, trial, and prison life can be tedious, this book is hard to put down. Readers will keep wondering when someone is going to listen to Fritz and do the right thing, but in the meantime it's almost like watching a train wreck in slow motion. In the process of sharing his story, Fritz comes across as truly remarkable and resilient. The only thing missing from the book is the story of his life since his release. Did the prosecutor and detectives express any remorse? What of the details of the real murderer's conviction? And how has the victim's family fared? There should be plenty of buzz for this book as John Grisham's "The Innocent Man" (not available for advance review), which tells the story of Fritz's also-exonerated codefendant, Ron Williamson, is due to be released at the same time.

All thought of that long-ago Hong Kong night vanished during the daylight hours only to reappear when sleep claimed the eighty-four-year-old woman. As the small rubber boat bobbed up and down in the cold waters outside Hong Kong harbor she remembered the feel of the piece of stone block and the touch of Garrison Lee&#x2019;s fingers as the dream continued. In her sleep the woman wanted to cry out that she didn&#x2019;t want the relic, she wanted him. As always in her dream all Lee would do is smile and wink that irritating wink he always did to make her think everything was all right&#x2014;she knew it wasn&#x2019;t. This was the same dream Alice had been having for the past six days and it always ended the same way&#x2014;with the feeling of massive loss and the sharp pain of her heart breaking every time she saw Garrison in the dream. <br>&#x201c;Hamilton, you&#x2019;re obviously dreaming this for a reason&#x2014; <i>now wake up!&#x201d;</i> <br>The voice of a man gone for a full year woke her as she lay at her small desk in her bedroom. She had fallen asleep again at her computer terminal and as she looked at the screen she saw the jumbled words in one long and continuous sentence, the result of her head lying on the keyboard. <br>Alice Hamilton reached out and angrily punched at the keyboard and cleared the screen of all the nonsensical words. As she yawned she looked at the clock on the wall. It was four-thirty in the morning and for the fifth straight night she had fallen asleep while in the midst of her research, and that in turn brought on the dreams of Garrison Lee and the time they spent together in China in the forties. Alice straightened in her chair, finally remembering what had prompted this dream in particular. She frantically searched the scattered papers on her usually neat desk. <br>&#x201c;Where is it, where is it!&#x201d; she asked herself, almost fearing the letter itself was part of her sleeping remembrances. <br> <i>&#x201c;Calm down and think,&#x201d;</i> came his voice. This was a tool she used many times. Garrison always told her think and then act. <br>Alice stopped her searching and then squeezed her eyes closed and thought. She opened them suddenly and reached for her robe&#x2019;s front pocket. She took a deep breath as her fingers touched the two-page letter that had been overnighted from Rome. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said as she pulled the letter from her pocket and opened it, sitting back in her chair as she did. Alice again closed her eyes realizing that she just thanked a man gone from her for what seemed an eternity. She swallowed and then caught herself and mentally shook the tears from her eyes before they fully developed and then opened the letter. She read it once more for the umpteenth time in the twenty-four hours since receiving it. <br>&#x201c;Europa, am I still signed in?&#x201d; she said aloud as she folded the letter but this time held it tightly in her hand as she forced herself to relax. Alice was finally feeling her age after many years of keeping up with the best of them. <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Hamilton, User 0012 is still logged on,&#x201d; came the sexy Marilyn Monroe&#x2013;voiced Cray supercomputer located at the secure center inside the Event Group complex underneath Nellis Air Force Base ten miles from her house. <br>&#x201c;My apologies for being rude and dozing off on you,&#x201d; Alice said as she pulled her robe tighter around her. <br>&#x201c;Computer center activity is light, access should be uninterrupted until 0600.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, thank you anyway, Europa. Now, can you&#x2026;&#x201d; Alice stopped briefly to stifle a yawn, making herself realize she was getting far too old for these all-night research digs. &#x201c;Excuse me, can you give me the status of security element Goliath please?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Security element Goliath has not reported in as of this time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Europa, I am expecting a package through the complex communications system and I want that e-mail package to come straight to me and is not, I repeat, is not to be entered into the incoming communications log. Is that clear?&#x201d; <br>For the first time in many years Europa didn&#x2019;t answer right away. Alice thought maybe her systems were still being disrupted from the troubles a few months earlier when her mainframe was attacked from an outside source. <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hamilton, your request cannot be granted due to security regulations.&#x201d; <br>Alice closed her eyes knowing that she could seal the incoming e-mail off from everyone&#x2014;except one man, and that was the head of Event Group security and the smartest man outside of Garrison Lee and Director Niles Compton that she had ever known&#x2014;Colonel Jack Collins. As far as she could see there was no way around Jack not seeing the e-mail, especially from a source as important to Department 5656 as anyone could ever remember&#x2014;Goliath, a code name for one of the security departments and Director Compton&#x2019;s most guarded deep operatives. The information this agent gives the Group is as important as any historical intelligence they had ever received from any one source. Goliath was deep&#x2014;the deepest any security element had ever been before, and only Jack, Niles, deputy director Virginia Pollock, Captain Carl Everett, and Alice knew who it was and where he, or she, was buried. <br>&#x201c;I understand, Europa, but no one else gets copied on the package. I hope I can handle Colonel Collins on this one security oversight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Incoming packet has arrived, Mrs. Hamilton.&#x201d; <br>Alice was stunned at how fast her requested data from their deep operative came as a follow-up to the first communication, which had set Alice on a course of action she had wanted to take since 1951. <br>&#x201c;Put it through, please,&#x201d; she said. <br>The coded pictures sent by Goliath slowly started coming up on her monitor as fast as Europa could decipher them. As she scanned the screen trying to figure out what the coded pixels were starting to form, her eyes started to widen and then recognition struck and with her usual self-control lost for the moment, Alice clapped her hands together and let out a yelp. She stood and hopped once as she picked up a picture of Garrison Lee that sat upon her desk. She kissed it, knowing in real life that gesture would have caused an immediate rebuke if it had not been done in private. She looked at the pictures once more as Europa broke them down into a four-square shot and they all clearly showed the item she had for so long searched. <br>&#x201c;You were right, damn you, you were right! This would have been something that had to have been covered up. And it was your idea to get someone inside&#x2014;oh, not for this, you old goat, but I figured our agent was in place anyway so why not have him do a little private searching for me?&#x201d; She kissed the picture again. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;ve got to kiss Jack and Niles for getting our agent placed!&#x201d; Alice stopped dancing and then looked at the picture of the one-eyed love of her life. &#x201c;Jack and Niles are going to hang me out to dry for this one,&#x201d; she said sadly, and then she suddenly smiled. &#x201c;But what the hell, Europa, I&#x2019;m fully vested so they can&#x2019;t take my retirement away.&#x201d; This time it was Alice who winked at Lee as he grimaced back from his eight-by-ten glossy. <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Hamilton, should I code-name and secure the file in your private program?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Europa, I also want you to place all files developed on the contents of Vault 22871 with this new file and secure it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Hamilton. Do you wish a code name for the new combined file?&#x201d; Europa asked in her sexy voice that Alice never quite noticed any longer. <br>&#x201c;Yes, code it&#x2014;Grimm.&#x201d; <br>VATICAN CITY, ROME, ITALY <br>The young Vatican counsel held the door open for a young woman. He nodded as she went past. Once outside he placed the black hat on his head and looked around the building. The cybercafe wasn&#x2019;t as crowded as it would be when the students hit just before classes started in less than an hour. <br>As he turned toward Vatican City a mile distant he felt the eyes on him just as he had the day before and then again this morning&#x2014;both times coming to and from his office and then from his office to the cybercafe. Now he was feeling it again. His training was either kicking in or he was starting to lose it. He dipped his head as he passed another young lady on the street. As he did he used the opportunity to glance in the storefront window to his right. Beyond his own reflection of black robe and collar he saw a lone woman about fifty feet behind him. Her gaze seemed just a little too intent on him. He quickened his pace. <br>Crossing St. Peter&#x2019;s Square he felt more secure as the crowds grew thick with tourists and others seeking the comfort of the city. He no longer felt the eyes upon him as he had. As he made his way back to his office inside the Vatican archival building he stopped and leaned down to tie a shoe that needed no tying. He again looked around and his heart froze. Not twenty feet away from where he had stopped that same young woman he had seen on the street was staring right at him. He was tempted to turn and walk toward the girl just to see what reaction he would get, but his training told him to cut and run and then report, let others far above his pay grade make the decisions. He did however reach his cell phone and then he brazenly straightened and started taking pictures like he was a normal tourist. He framed the young woman in his fourth shot of the milling crowd. For good measure he took another just as her face went stern and she turned away. The young Vatican archivist smiled and turned away himself. <br>The man deep undercover at the Vatican, United States Army Second Lieutenant Leonard DeSilva, knew he would have to report to Colonel Collins in Nevada, because if his cover inside the Vatican was blown there was going to be hell to pay. <br>The young priest, who had spent the past year and a half after graduating from Notre Dame fighting for his assignment at the Vatican, knew he would have to call home for instructions&#x2014;and that entailed a call to Department 5656&#x2014;the Event Group. <br>TEL AVIV, ISRAEL <br>Lieutenant General Addis Shamni slowly laid down the report from his agent at the Vatican and then slammed his hand down upon it. He raised that same hand to his forehead and then cursed his bad luck. <br>&#x201c;With everything going on in the world I have to deal with this!&#x201d; he said aloud as his hand left his furrowed brow and slammed into the report once more. &#x201c;How in the hell did someone get a man inside the archives when the Mossad couldn&#x2019;t get into the damn lobby just for a research paper!&#x201d; <br>Lieutenant Colonel Avis Ben-Nevin sat silently in his chair as he listened to the general angrily curse the file in front of him. The colonel with his meticulously trimmed pencil-thin mustache saw the fear in a man&#x2019;s eyes that up until now had never known the feeling. He knew this involved the Vatican, an area the lieutenant colonel had a special and vested interest in. Ben-Nevin was known as the religious factor inside the Mossad. Anything and everything that had to do with religion inside the state of Israel, Ben-Nevin had a firm grasp of it and the event happening at this moment in Italy had a firm hold on the colonel&#x2019;s imagination. <br>&#x201c;Colonel, you may have to get on a plane to Rome and find out exactly what is going on here. I need someone on station that knows just what in the hell they&#x2019;re doing. Young Sorotzkin is one of the best but she may be out of her element where Ramesses is concerned.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perhaps if I could be briefed on Project Ramesses I could&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>The general looked up with an arched graying eyebrow. <br>&#x201c;You could what, read something that could possibly get you killed by someone higher in rank than myself? Colonel, outside of this office that code name is never to be mentioned. Your father knew of it and took it to his grave.&#x201d; The eyes of the general bore into the younger Mossad officer. &#x201c;You are to evaluate the situation with Major Sorotzkin, then report back to me. Nothing is to be done with this American spy. This may be our chance to get into the archives and find out exactly what the Holy Roman Church knows about our history.&#x201d; <br>Ben-Nevin knew he was on the trail that his father had discovered four decades earlier in Hong Kong and the trail just got a little warmer. <br>&#x201c;You are not to bring your normal religious zeal into this mission. Get to Rome, evaluate, and report back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;General, I know I am considered the religious laughingstock around here, but anyone who believes that our religion has nothing to do with how we are viewed, or even perceived in our world, especially our near world, well, that&#x2019;s a bit naive on your part. Our heritage is what makes us strong and any evidence of that heritage we can uncover will go a long way to proving we should reign in this part of the world.&#x201d; <br>General Shamni slowly stood and placed his thick arms on his desk and then leaned forward. &#x201c;Reign, Colonel Ben-Nevin? We are just trying to survive here. If we can be friends with our neighbors through cooperation and mutual respect then that is our goal. Not to point to them and say, <i>&#x2018;See, we were right and you were wrong and God is on our side.</i>&#x2019;&#x201d; This time the general smiled but the gesture was not meant to be sincere in the least. The general hated Ben-Nevin and the colonel knew it. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thing our young state has learned, Colonel, is the very real fact that God has never been on anyone&#x2019;s side. As a matter of fact I have come to the conclusion that if he ever was, he&#x2019;s cut the apron strings on us&#x2014;as the Americans like to say. We are too far along to be killing people over these ancient tales.&#x201d; <br>This time Ben-Nevin smiled. &#x201c;This stuff is the manna of our history, proof that we were meant to be here. If Operation Ramesses could prove the world wrong in that regard, why we could&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Enough!&#x201d; This time the hand came down and its impact shook the desk lamp. &#x201c;Colonel, you have pushed and pushed on this very closed loop matter far too long, and the funny thing is I couldn&#x2019;t give you the details of Ramesses even if I knew them. Our policy on the operation has been in place since the time of David Ben-Gurion. And your assertion that Ramesses can save the situation in the Middle East is highly dubious at best, especially since you know nothing of its details. From what I understand Ramesses would do, at least according to our experts, is ignite a wave of religious fundamentalism the likes of which the world has never seen. That cannot happen and will not happen as long as this administration is in place&#x2014;and every administration of whatever political stripe after. Now get to Rome.&#x201d; <br>Ben-Nevin gave the general a halfhearted salute and then turned on his heel. The general didn&#x2019;t see the small smile lift his thin mustache. <br>&#x201c;Sergeant Rosen!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; <br>The general looked up as his assistant popped her head inside the door. <br>&#x201c;Get me the prime minister,&#x201d; was all he said as he inadvertently picked up the field report again and cursed his eyes for reading the words. He didn&#x2019;t acknowledge his assistant as she ducked out of the office. <br>&#x201c;The prime minister is on line one, General.&#x201d; <br>With a minimum of motion the general snatched up the phone and hit the flashing button. <br>&#x201c;Mr. Prime Minister, a trail to our heritage may have been discovered by unknown sources.&#x201d; The general paused to rub the throbbing that had just started coursing through his temples. &#x201c;Sir, we have a problem&#x2014;a three-thousand-year-old nightmare from the past kind of problem.&#x201d; <br>After the general&#x2019;s conversation with the prime minister&#x2019;s office was completed, exactly thirty-two minutes later the elite commando arm of the Israeli Defense Forces; the Sayeret <i>&#x2014;</i>one o...</p><h2>You Are My Work of Art</h2><p>Everyone is as unique and beautiful as a classic work of art, whether you are <i>Great Wave Off Kanagawa</i> with the power of the sea,&#x201d; or <i>Starry Night</i>, a galaxy of love.&#x201d; Lift the flaps to reveal classic works of art beneath!

A half-mad, unbearably beautiful heiress follows a strange man home, seeking total sexual abandon: He only wants to watch game shows. A woman falls in love with a hunchback; when his deformity turns out to be a prosthesis, she leaves him. A wife whose husband has just returned from the war struggles with the heartrending question: Can she still love a man who has no lips?<br><br>Aimee Bender's stories portray a world twisted on its axis, a place of unconvention that resembles nothing so much as real life, in all its grotesque, beautiful glory. From the first line of each tale she lets us know she is telling a story, but the moral is never quite what we expect. Bender's prose is glorious: musical and colloquial, inimitable and heartrending.<br><br>Here are stories of men and women whose lives are shaped--and sometimes twisted--by the power of extraordinary desires, erotic and otherwise. <i>The Girl in the Flammable Skirt</i> is the debut of a major American writer.</p><p>In conventional fiction, war heroes return home minus an arm or a leg--or, to take Hemingway's worst-case scenario, the family jewels. In Aimee Bender's deeply unconventional collection, however, an even more suggestive body part goes AWOL: "Steve returned from the war without his lips." The army doctors have temporarily replaced them with a plastic disc, which impairs his speech. Luckily, this doesn't prevent him and his wife from engaging in some slightly surrealistic sexual maneuvers: "That night in bed, he grazed the disc over her raised nipples like a UFO and the plastic was cool on her skin. It felt like they were in college and toying with desk items as sexual objects."<p> That same combo--sex and off-kilter surrealism--provides Bender with her modus operandi. In "Call My Name," for example, a young heiress tails a stranger back to his apartment, gets her dress sliced off, and then consents to be trussed to a chair while he watches a TV documentary about Mozart. "Quiet Please" features a libidinous librarian who takes on all, uh, comers in the back room. Bender isn't, it should be said, simply a purveyor of French postcards. Her prose is exquisitely shaped, and its singsong rhythms suggest something out of a wised-up, whacked-out fairy tale. Indeed, if the Brothers Grimm had been a little more attuned to the pleasure principle, their fables might have boasted at least a family resemblance to Aimee Bender's. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"Aimee Bender's debut is a string of jewels."<br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Superbly imagined.

Here you see proof. The odds were in my favor, yet fortune stood at your side. You have won. &#34;Yes.&#34; Tamar breathed again. He stared at the diamond. Jaya scooped up the dice and once more dropped them into the cup. &#34;A small loss,&#34; he said, &#34;but I shall try to regain it.&#34; &#34;No need.&#34; Tamar pushed the diamond and chain across the board. His hands shook, as if he had just been pulled back from the edge of a cliff. &#34;Enough. I have no desire to play again. A friendly game-friends do not keep each others possessions. Take back your wager. I shall find you some better distraction, if it pleases you.&#34; &#34;It does not please me. You dishonor me by scorning what you rightfully won.&#34; &#34;Call it a gift. Call it whatever you choose. I play no more.&#34; &#34;That is not for you to say,&#34; Jaya returned. &#34;By rule, it is I who declare the game over. No. I set the stakes again. Double what they were.&#34; Tamar&#39;s face tightened. What Jaya proposed would have put most of Sundari&#39;s treasure at risk. Tamar shook his head. &#34;A king serves his people as well as himself, and answers to them for his actions. For me, it would be reckless stewardship.&#34; &#34;Will you be reckless with your honor? You agreed to the rules of aksha, did you not? Obey them.&#34; &#34;Lower the stakes, then, as you first offered to do.&#34; &#34;At first, yes. You did not accept. I no longer offer.&#34; Jaya leaned over the table. &#34;The game continues; we will play it out. A childish pastime? Also a question of dharma. We are both bound by dharma, King of Sundari. &#34;I do not break dharma,&#34; Jaya went on. &#34;But you, if you choose to break yours by refusing, so be it. End the game-and shame yourself. Tamar&#39;s blood rose. &#34;Take up the dice.&#34; Jaya rattled the cup and casually spilled out its contents. &#34;How interesting. Once more, the odds favor me. Once more, will fortune favor you?&#34; The dice danced on the board as Tamar threw in turn. Jaya&#39;s smile was thin as a thread. &#34;You have won again, King of Sundari. Now, to me. At triple the stakes.&#34; Without awaiting a reply, Jaya cast the dice. When Tamar played in turn, his head spun like the ivory cubes. He dimly grasped that his score was higher than his opponent&#39;s. &#34;Truly, you are fortune&#39;s darling,&#34; Jaya said. &#34;We play on. Triple what I have lost.&#34; How long even a maharajah might continue so rashly, Tamar could not guess. Winning the next turn yet again, Tamar gave up trying to calculate what he had gained. King though he was, he had never imagined such wealth within his reach. His thoughts raced over all the plans he had, until now, only dreamed: waterways from the outlying hills to the public squares, parks and gardens throughout the city, wide streets, shining new buildings, houses for even the poorest of his subjects. He seized the dice cup eagerly, threw-and won again. He was giddy, flushed with wild joy and soaked in cold sweat. The king of Mahapura yawned. &#34;The game grows boring. One final throw for each of us. But, to play for meaningless trinkets --- surely there are more exciting wagers. Something to add a touch of spice, a little stimulation.&#34; &#34;Wager what you please,&#34; Tamar said impatiently. The game had caught him up and held him in its arms like a lover, whispering in his ear. &#34;Honor binds you to accept it.&#34; As I do. Lay down the stakes. &#34;Life against life.&#34; Tamar&#39;s head went back as if he had been struck. He was suddenly cold. &#34;I do not understand.&#34; &#34;Very simple.&#34; Jaya folded his arms and looked impassively at Tamar. &#34;Win, my life is yours to do with as you please. Lose, your life is forfeit to me.&#34; &#34;I cannot --- &#34; &#34;Can. And must.&#34; With a lazy movement, Jaya scattered the dice over the board. He pursed his lips. &#34;Fortune still favors you. My score is small, easily surpassed.&#34; Tamar&#39;s fingers had gone numb, scarcely able to hold the cup. The dice seemed to leap out by their own will. &#34;King of Sundari,&#34; Jaya said, &#34;you have lost.&#34; For long moments, Tamar did not speak. Then, in a voice he barely recognized as his own, he murmured, &#34;This is folly. Madness.&#34; &#34;No. It is honor,&#34; Jaya said. &#34;And you, so proud of keeping it, learn what it truly is. Have you ever tested it? I think not.&#34; &#34;I lost a wager. I still keep my honor.&#34; &#34;Then obey dharma.&#34; Jaya rose, taller than he had first appeared. &#34;Hear me; understand me well. I leave you now; I have other matters to deal with. But, from this moment, you are at my command. You will go to my palace in Mahapura and there make good on your debt. Vow to do so without fail.&#34; Tamar stood and looked squarely at Jaya. &#34;You have my word as king and kshatriya. &#34; &#34;I accept it.&#34; Jaya nodded. He gripped Tamar&#39;s wrist in one hand with such strength that Tamar clenched his teeth to keep from crying out; and, with the other, set a ring of black iron on his finger. &#34;The emblem of your pledge,&#34; Jaya said. &#34;Your life is my property.&#34; &#34;So, King of Mahapura,&#34; Tamar flung back, &#34;what will you do with it?&#34; &#34;How dare you question me?&#34; Jaya answered in a voice of cold stones grinding against each other. &#34;Do I explain myself to a dog if I choose to kill him?&#34; He dropped Tamar&#39;s wrist and turned away. &#34;I am not your dog!&#34; Tamar lunged after him. Jaya was already through the doorway. Tamar would have followed, but a roar like breaking surf filled his ears. His legs gave way; he stumbled and fell to the floor. The ring felt as if it had been bound tight around his heart. &#34;I am not your dog!&#34; he shouted again. And again. Until he drowned in the echoes.

There's a reason for that. Soup is the original comfort food. It's digestible--didn't your mother serve you soup when you had an upset stomach?--and it's economical, too. Back in Ukraine, where food had to be stretched, especially during the long, harsh winters, soup was a lifesaver. So it's no surprise that soup has been offered at Veselka since its opening day. Long before <i>Seinfeld</i> made the soup guy famous, we were ladling it out by the gallon. Soup is very forgiving, too. If you've never cooked a thing in your life, soup is the perfect place to start--it's impossible to get it wrong, and any misstep can be fixed. After you've made these recipes a few times, you should feel free to experiment with them. If you've got a handful of cooked rice, use that in place of barley, or add some leftover vegetables, as long as you think their taste will blend. The only thing that soup <i>won't</i> forgive is low-quality ingredients. I don't believe in saving a dollar here and a dollar there; I think in the end you make more money with quality. So at Veselka, with soups and everything else, we go the extra mile. For example, lots of restaurants--and home cooks, too--make chicken soup using bones and necks and wings and backs, but we always start with whole chickens. That results in a rounder, less bitter flavor, and it also means that we then have lots of boiled chicken meat to shred back into the soup and to use in other recipes as well. In general, at the restaurant we cook a lot of ingredients separately, then combine them into a single soup at the end. This gives us a little more control over the individual components of the soup. In the morning we get a little soup assembly linegoing with various pots bubbling on the stove. There is always one soup or another cooking in the Veselka kitchen, though we don't make each kind every day. We rotate them. Our various types of borscht are among the most popular, and we also sell Cabbage Soup, a Ukrainian favorite made with sauerkraut, that's no longer available in many places. And every day we make one special soup, usually something seasonal, like our Butternut Squash Soup. A person could live on soup for a long, long time, and this collection of soup recipes provides a great start. <i>A Bowl of Borscht</i> There has never been a day in Veselka's fifty years without borscht on the menu. You know that guy in the Dunkin' Donuts commercial who used to say, "Time to make the donuts"? Well, at Veselka the beginning of the week and the middle of the week are "time to make the borscht." We start with over 250 pounds of beets, which are simmered and then allowed to cool on the first day of preparation. Our cooks refer to the resulting ruby-red liquid as "beet water." The next day we make a rich beef stock, and on the third day we combine the various ingredients. That results in just enough soup to last half a week, and one day later we begin all over again. Simply put, borscht is beet soup, but borscht is far from simple at Veselka. We serve five different kinds of borscht: our standard version (which uses meat broth), a vegetarian version, Christmas borscht with dumplings, cold borscht (in summer), and white borscht--a special traditional variation made sour with either sauerkraut or fermented wheat. While borscht is served throughout Eastern Europe and is a staple of Jewish cuisine (the word <i>bors</i> means "soup" in Yiddish), it is believed to have originated in Ukraine, and no wonder. Ukraine has many fine qualities, but excellent weather is not one of them. However, root vegetables like beets grow easily in the region, along with cabbage, and root vegetables could be stored in cellars in the days before refrigeration. There is little in life as comforting as sitting down to a bowl of ruby red borscht--we can only imagine how livelyand tempting that sight was to someone entering a third month of below-zero temperatures and frozen terrain, or alternately, how refreshing a bowl of cold borscht would have been on a hot summer day. In modern-day New York City, we may have heat and air conditioning, but that doesn't make a steaming bowl of borscht any less tempting. Cold borscht makes an elegant starter to a formal meal, while to us, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a dish of clear borscht with dumplings. The recipes for borscht in this book have been tested and retested so that you can re-create Veselka's borscht at home, but I think almost any Veselka customer would agree that nothing beats a bowl of the real thing, eaten right here. VESELKA'S FAMOUS BORSCHT Makes about 2 quarts; 8 first-course or 4 to 6 main-course servings <i>Borscht</i> is <i>Veselka: We serve 5,000 gallons of the stuff every year. While at Veselka we cook the beets and the meat on separate days, you can do it all at the same time, as long as you've got enough large pots to handle it all. None of the work is very time-consuming, although the individual components simmer for several hours, so you'll need to pick a time when you'll be home, though not necessarily in the kitchen. You can easily double or triple this recipe (again, as long as you have large enough pots). After all, at Veselka, we work with 250 pounds of beets at a time. And keep in mind that borscht, like most soups, freezes beautifully.</i> <i>The beets for our borscht are cooked in two separate batches: One batch is used to make "beet water," a kind of rich beet stock. The remaining beets are cooked and grated. The process may sound a little complicated when you read it, but after you follow the instructions once, the logic will become clear, and I'm convinced that it's this two-step process that lends our borscht its distinct taste and depth of flavor.</i> <i>You won't taste the white vinegar much, by the way, but it helps the beets retain the beautiful red color that is their hallmark. Without it, your borscht may take on a brownish tinge. If you are very sensitive to the taste of vinegar, use the full amount to cook the beet water and the beets, but in step 7, add it to the soup in small amounts, tasting in between.</i> &nbsp; <br> 3 pounds (10 to 12) small beets, scrubbed thoroughly but <i>not</i> peeled 9 tablespoons white vinegar One 2-pound boneless pork butt, halved 8 cups Beef Stock 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon whole allspice berries 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 3 large carrots, peeled and sliced 3 large celery stalks, sliced 1 small head of green cabbage (about � to 1 pound), shredded (about 4 cups) 2 medium Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice One 15-ounce can lima beans, drained and rinsed Salt 1. To make the "beet water," roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar. 2. Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red. 3. Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve to make Beet Salad . Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups. 4. Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool. 5. When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade. 6. To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into 1/2-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth. 7. To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside. 8. To compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the "beet water" and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately. Variation: <i>We also serve Vegetarian Borscht at Veselka, which is a little lighter and can be a better choice than traditional meat-based borscht when it's being served as part of a multicourse meal. For Vegetarian Borscht, simply leave out the pork butt, bay leaf, allspice, berries, and peppercorns, and skip step 6. In step 7, cook the vegetables in water or</i> <i>Vegetable Stock</i> <i>.</i> COLD BORSCHT Makes about 2 quarts; 8 first-course or 4 main-course servings <i>Cold beet soup is tangy and refreshing--it's perfect on a really hot, humid day. If you're serving this as the first course in a fancy meal, pour it into tall glasses rather than bowls. The color is gorgeous.</i> &nbsp; <br> 1 pound (about 3) beets, scrubbed thoroughly but <i>not</i> peeled 1/2 cup half-and-half 1 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons white vinegar 4 large eggs, hard-boiled 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 small cucumber, peeled and diced 1. To make the "beet water," chop the beets roughly and place them in a stockpot. Add water to cover, at least 8 cups. 2. Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to partially cover the pot with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid should be bright red. 3. Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard pulp or reserve to make Beet Salad . Reserve 3 cups of the beet water and set aside to cool completely. (If you have any leftover beet water, you can reserve it for another use or simply discard it.) 4. When the beet water has cooled, whisk it with the half-and-half and buttermilk. Add the sugar and vinegar and whisk until the sugar is dissolved and all the ingredients are combined. Chill until serving time. 5. Peel and chop the hard-boiled eggs. 6. To serve the soup, ladle portions into individual soup bowls and garnish each bowl with a sprinkling of fresh dill, chopped hard-boiled egg, and diced cucumber. WHITE BORSCHT Makes 21/2 quarts; 6 to 8 servings <i>This unusual soup is generally served on holidays. It has a somewhat tart taste similar to sourdough bread. At Veselka, we use sauerkraut juice, but in some parts of Eastern Europe grain is fermented (similar to a sourdough starter) to make white borscht, and white vinegar will work as well. Sour soup sounds odd, I know, but this is highly addictive.</i> &nbsp; <br> 6 cups Chicken Stock 2 medium ham hocks 3 smoked pork ribs, optional 1 medium onion, minced 3 large carrots, chopped 4 celery stalks, chopped 2 bay leaves 2 whole allspice berries � cup sour cream 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour � cup sauerkraut juice, or 2 teaspoons white vinegar 1 tablespoon dried marjoram 1 teaspoon dried oregano Salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 medium Idaho potatoes, cooked, peeled, and chopped 4 large eggs, hard-boiled and coarsely chopped 1. Place the chicken stock, ham hocks, pork ribs, if using, onion, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and allspice berries in a medium stockpot. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then lower to a gentle simmer and cook over low heat for 40 minutes. 2. Remove the ham hocks and ribs, if using, and discard. Strain out the vegetables and discard. 3. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and the flour until very smooth. 4. Return the stock to a boil and stir in the sour cream-flour mixture. Add about half the sauerkraut juice or vinegar, taste, and add additional sauerkraut juice or vinegar, if desired. Stir in the marjoram and oregano, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes. 5. Season to taste with salt (depending on how salty your sauerkraut juice is, it may not need any additional salt) and pepper. 6. Ladle the soup into individual serving bowls and garnish each serving with a few cubes of cooked potato and a sprinkling of chopped hard-boiled egg. Serve hot. CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP Makes about 2 quarts; 6 servings <i>After borscht, chicken noodle is our most popular soup. On a cold day, a rainy day, or really any day at all when you need a bit of a lift, chicken noodle soup is ideal. Chicken soup also has amazing healing powers: It has been scientifically proven to help colds heal faster. You can make the soup in advance, but if you're going to freeze chicken noodle soup, thaw it and cook the noodles in the broth just before serving. At Veselka, we use a whole chicken to make our soup. Not only does this result in a richer, more balanced broth, but you then have cooked chicken that can be used in so many different ways--</i> <i>Chicken Salad</i> <i>, sandwiches, or just eaten plain.</i> &nbsp; <br> One 31/2-pound chicken 1 large onion, peeled 3 celery stalks, sliced 3 large carrots, sliced 3 leeks, halved lengthwise and thoroughly cleaned Salt 3 cups fine egg noodles � cup minced flat-leaf parsley, for garnish 1. Place the chicken, onion, celery, carrot, and leeks in a large stockpot and add water to cover, at least 10 cups. Place over high heat, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered (though you may want to partially cover the pot with a lid to stop the stovetop from being splattered), until the chicken meat is falling off the bone, about 1 hour. Skim off the fat and foam from the surface occasionally. 2. Remove the pot from the heat with the chicken still in the broth and allow to cool to room temperature. 3. Remove the chicken from the pot. Pull any meat from the bone and shred into large, rough pieces. Strain the chicken stock. Discard the onion and leeks, but set aside the celery and carrots. (Don't worry about a stray piece of onion or leek making its way in as well.) 4. Return the stock to the pot. Bring to a boil, add salt to taste, and toss in the noodles.

Jones is the author of the bestselling Book of Words trilogy, <i>The Barbed Coil,</i> and the first two books of the Sword of Shadows, <i>A Cavern of Black Ice</i> and <i>A Fortress of Grey Ice.</i> Born in England, she now makes her home in San Diego, California.</p>Chapter 1<br>Ash.<br>Raif woke with a start, immediately sitting upright. His heart was pumping hard in his chest and there was a rawness in his throat as if he had been screaming. A quick glance at Bear showed the sturdy little hill pony&#x2019;s ears were twitching. Probably had been screaming then.<br>Ash&#x2019;s name.<br>Raif shook his head, hoping to drive away all thoughts of her. Nothing could be gained by them. Madness lay in wait here, in the vast and shifting landscape of the Great Want, and to worry about Ash March and crave her presence was a sure way to drive himself insane. She was gone. He could not have her. It was as simple and as unchangeable as that.<br>Rising to his feet, Raif forced himself to evaluate the landscape. Thirst made his tongue feel big in his mouth. He ignored it. Light was moving through the Want and the last of the bright stars were fading. In the direction that might have been east, the horizon was flushed with the first suggestion of sun. The landscape seemed familiar. Scale-covered rock formations rose from the buckled limestone floor like stalagmites, craggy and jagged, silently farming minerals as they grew. On the ground, a litter of lime fragments and calcified insect husks cracked beneath his boots like chicken bones. Bear was snuffling something that a while back might have been a plant. As Raif&#x2019;s gaze moved from the distant purple peaks floating above the mist, to the canyon lines that forked Want-north across the valley floor, he felt some measure of relief. It looked pretty much like the place he had set camp in last night.<br>Anchored, that was the word. The Want had not drifted while he slept.<br>Grateful for that, Raif crossed over to Bear and started rubbing down her coat. She head-butted him, sniffing for water, but it was too early for her morning ration so he pushed her head back gently and told her, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>The puncture wounds caused by the Shatan Maer&#x2019;s claws had stiffened his left shoulder muscle, and as he worked on Bear&#x2019;s hooves he felt some pain. When he made a quick movement up her leg, a cold little tingle traveled toward his heart. Stopping for a moment, he put a hand on Bear&#x2019;s belly to steady himself. Something about the pain, a kind of liquid probing, had unsettled him, and he couldn&#x2019;t seem to get the Shatan Maer out of his head. He could smell its rankness, see its cunning dead eyes as it came for him.<br>Shivering, Raif stepped away from the pony. &#x201c;Do I look mad to you?&#x201d; he asked her as he massaged the aching muscle.<br>Bear flicked her tail lazily; a pony&#x2019;s equivalent of a shrug. The gesture was strangely reassuring. Sometimes that was all it took to drive away your fears: the indifference of another living thing. The pain was just the last remnants of an infection, nothing more.<br>Although he didn&#x2019;t much feel like it, Raif set about taking stock of his meager supplies. Fresh water had become a problem. The aurochs&#x2019; bladder rested slack against a block of limestone, its contents nearly drained. The little that remained tasted of rawhide. Raif doubted whether it would last the day. There was food&#x2014;sprouted millet for the pony, hard cheese and pemmican for himself&#x2014;yet he knew enough not to be tempted by it. He wanted to be sure where his next drink was coming from before he ate. Yesterday he&#x2019;d learned that it wasn&#x2019;t enough just to see water. In the Want you had to jump in it and watch your clothes get wet before you could be absolutely certain it was there. Yesterday he and Bear had tracked leagues out of their way to pursue a glassy shimmer in the valley between two hills. They stood in that valley today. It wasn&#x2019;t just dry, it was bone dry, and Raif had been left feeling like a fool. You&#x2019;d think he would have learned by now.<br>Unable to help himself, he flicked the cap off the waterskin and squirted a small amount into his mouth. The fluid was gone before he had a chance to swallow it, sucked away by parched gums. He was tempted to take more, but resisted. His duty to his animal came first.<br>As he poured a careful measure into the pony&#x2019;s waxed snufflebag, Raif wondered what heading to take next. As best he could tell, five days had passed since he&#x2019;d left the Fortress of Grey Ice. The first few days were lost to him, gone in a fever dream of blood poisoning and pain. He did not recall leaving the fortress or choosing a route to lead them out of the Want. He remembered waking one morning and looking at his left arm and not being sure that it belonged to him. The skin floated on top of the muscle as if separated by a layer of liquid. It leaked when he pressed it, clear fluid that seeped through a crack Raif supposed must be a wound. The strange thing was it hadn&#x2019;t hurt. Even stranger, he could not recall being concerned.<br>At some point he must have regained his mind, although there were times when he wasn&#x2019;t sure. The wounds on his neck were healing. He&#x2019;d stitched the deepest one without use of a mirror, so gods only knew what he looked like. As for his arm, it certainly looked a lot better. And he was definitely sure it was his. His mind was a different story though, a little foggy around the edges and prone to fancies. The first day that he tried to ride his head had felt too light, and he&#x2019;d convinced himself he was better off walking instead.<br>He hadn&#x2019;t been on Bear since then, and he&#x2019;d spent the last three days stubbornly walking. Occasionally Bear looked at him quizzically, and had once gone as far as head-butting the small of his back to encourage him to ride. She had wanted to help, he knew that, and the one thing she had to offer was her ability to bear his weight.<br>Raif licked his lips. They were as dry as tree bark. Reaching inside the grain bag, he scooped up a handful a millet. Bear, whose thoughts were never far from food, trotted over to investigate. She ate from his hand, lipping hard to get at the grains that were jammed between his fingers. She didn&#x2019;t understand that in many ways she was the one who was caring for him. Her company alone was worth more than a month&#x2019;s worth of supplies. Bear&#x2019;s stoic acceptance of her situation lightened his heart. Caring for her needs&#x2014;making sure she had enough food and water, tending to her coat, skin, and mouth, and keeping her shoes free of stone&#x2014;kept him from focusing on himself.<br>And then there was her Want sense. The little hill pony borrowed from the Maimed Men had an instinct for moving through the Great Want. Instead of fighting the insubstantial nature of the landscape, she gave herself up to it, became a leaf floating downstream. As a clansman trained to navigate dense forests, follow the whisper-light trails left by ice hares and foxes, and hold his bearings on frozen tundra in a whiteout, Raif found traveling through the Want frustrating. The sun might rise in the morning, but then again it might not. Entire mountain ranges could sail on the horizon like ships. Clouds formed rings that hung in the sky, unaffected by prevailing winds, for days. At night a great wheel of stars would turn in the heavens, but you could never be sure what constellations it would contain. Sometimes the wheel reversed itself and moved counter to every wisdom concerning the stars that Raif had ever been taught. Orienting oneself in such an environment was close to impossible. As soon as you had established the direction of due north, decided on a course to lead you out, the Want began to slip through your fingers like snowmelt. Nothing was fixed here. Everything&#x2014;the sky, the land, the sun and the moon&#x2014;drifted to the movement of some unknowable tide.<br>The Great Want could not be mastered or explained. Ancient sorceries had scarred it, time had worn away its boundaries, and cataclysmic disasters had scoured it clean of life. The Want was no longer bound by physical laws. To attempt to traverse it was folly. The best you could hope for was rite of passage. Somehow Bear knew this, knew that relinquishing&#x2014;not asserting&#x2014;control would carry one farther in this place.<br>Every night since they had left the fortress the pony had stumbled upon a suitable place to set camp. She found islands elevated above the vast mist rivers that flowed across the Want at sunset, sniffed out caves sunk deep into cliff faces, and hollows protected from the harsh morning winds. She&#x2019;d even located a riverbed where ancient bushes had been sucked so dry of life juice that they burned as smokeless as the purest fuel. The hill pony hadn&#x2019;t found drinkable water yet, but Raif knew that out of the two of them she had the best chance of discovering it.<br>That, and the way out.<br>Frowning, Raif scanned the horizon. A constant bitter wind blew against his face, scouring his cheeks with ice crystals and filling his nose with the smell of ozone and lead; the scent of faraway storms. Part of him was content simply to drift. As long as he was here, at the Want&#x2019;s mercy, he need make no decisions about the future. Questions about whether to return to the Maimed Men or head south in search of Ash had little meaning. In a way it was a kind of relief. The past three days were the most peace he had known since that morning in the Badlands when his da and Dagro Blackhail had died.<br>That sense of peace would not last for long. Mor Drakka, Watcher of the Dead, Oathbreaker, Twelve Kill: a man possessing such names could not expect to live a peaceful life.<br>Kneeling on his bedroll, Raif reached for the sword given to him by the Listener of the Ice Trappers. The once perfectly tempered blade was warped and blackened, its edges blunted and untrue. Plunged into shadowflesh up to its crossguard, the sword had been irrevocably changed. It would never be more than a knock-around now, the kind of blade a fath...</p><h2>The Illustrated A Brief History of Time / The Universe in a Nutshell Collectibl</h2><p>New, and pristine.

Emphasizing the strong connection between liberalism and democracy, he debunks the myth of the moral superiority of the conservative viewpoint. With an excellent forward by Anne Eleanor Roosevelt, God And Other Famous Liberals is divided into three sections: Reclaiming the Bible (The Most Famous Liberal of All; God's Son Jesus; The Holy Spirit); Reclaiming the Flag (With Liberty for All; We Hold These Truths; One Nation Under God); and Reclaiming the Family (Your Mother is a Liberal; E Pluribus Unum). The book concludes with an Epilogue, Appendix; and an Index. God And Other Famous Liberals is recommended reading for everyone, freethinker or religionist, who support the principles of church-state separation, and whose are saddened by the spectacle of the Religious Right claiming moral superiority over not only the "Godless Humanist" but the Religious Left as well. Insightful, very well written in an engaging style, and as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote: "This thoughtful and and spirited book reminds us all that the Bible and the flag are not the private property of the radical right. " Forrest Church is pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City, and the author of numerous books including: Father and Son, Everyday Miracles, and The Seven Deadly Virtues. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i>Cheerleading manual for politico-religious liberalism, by an N.Y.C. Unitarian minister. Church (Father and Son, 1985) loves the ``L word''; what's more, he believes that God loves it too: ``God, the most famous liberal of all, has a bleeding heart that never stops,'' he quips, and then tosses in some apple pie for good measure: ``every good mother and father is a liberal.'' Behind this jaunty sloganeering lies an instructive history exercise, an attempt to trace the roots of American liberalism back to the Bible and the Founding Fathers. Church finds a ``liberal social gospel,'' which he defines as ``love to God and love to neighbor,'' in the teachings of Jesus, in the free-worship statues of the colony of Rhode Island, in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and in the words of both Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King. He does concede some liberal errors--overprotection of criminals, government paternalism--but the battle cry is sounded: faith, flag, family, and federal government--all these belong by right to the liberals. Amazing in its single-mindedness, amusing in its silliness (Church takes the time to argue that Jesus would have opposed prayer in public schools), finally poignant in its quixotism. Liberals will love it, but unless the political climate swerves to the left, conservatives will laugh all the way to next Inauguration Day. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Because he cannot remember from day to day, Latro describes events in a scroll. His senses, intensified by his injury, enable him to see many things, including gods circulating among mortals. Verna delivers a full-voiced narration with subtle vocal characterizations. His voice is a gentle baritone, slightly higher for a young girl, slowed into oiliness for the snake god. Like most modern fantasies, this includes scenes of violence: child sacrifice, castration, others. A masterful work for a wide audience. D.W.

Wodehouse</b><br><br><b>The first novel in the Flashman series</b><br><br> Fraser revives Flashman, a caddish bully from <i>Tom Brown's Schooldays</i> by Thomas Hughes, and relates Flashman&#x2019;s adventures after he is expelled in drunken disgrace from Rugby school in the late 1830s. Flashy enlists in the Eleventh Light Dragoons and is promptly sent to India and Afghanistan, where despite his consistently cowardly behavior he always manages to come out on top. Flashman is an incorrigible anti-hero for the ages. This humorous adventure book will appeal to fans of historical fiction, military fiction, and British history as well as to fans of Clive Cussler, James Bond, and The Three Musketeers.</p><p><b>George MacDonald Fraser</b> was a bestselling historical novelist, journalist and screenwriter. He is perhaps most famous for his series of Flashman novels, featuring his antihero Harry Flashman. In addition to his novels, he wrote numerous screenplays, most notably <i>The Three Musketeers</i> and the James Bond film <i>Octopussy</i>. George MacDonald Fraser died in 2008 at the age of 82.<i>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t wait to die on the field of honour. Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>Your Defiant Teen, First Edition: 10 Steps to Resolve Conflict and Rebuild Your Relationship</h2><p>When your teen&#x2019;s rebellious behavior &#x201c;crosses the line,&#x201d; how can you reestablish your authority without getting caught in a power struggle?

And what pleasure Larkwhistle provides my partner and me! After more than a decade, an early-morning tour of our flowerbeds is still more of a certainty than breakfast is -- and every bit as nourishing. Each bed or border brings its own gifts: fat bumblebees, brilliant butterflies, the sultry scent of trumpet lilies and the heady bouquet of peonies. Colours change from day to day, flower following flower as spring days warm into summer, then cool toward autumn. Trilling redwings, yodelling bobolinks and, of course, whistling meadowlarks sound the signals for changes of phase and bloom as Larkwhistle, a place of rest and renewal, this garden we call home, makes its way through yet another spring, summer and fall, the three glorious seasons of northern perennials. </p><p> Larkwhistle is devoted to perennials. Here, the moment the snow curtain lifts in March, the drama of a new season begins. At this early date, the maple trees in the woods across the way are holding their buds in check, lilac and honeysuckle shrubs stand stark and leafless against the pale sky, and the vegetable beds are bare. But in the flower garden, things are happening already. After a day or two of south winds and sunshine, tentative sparks of colour appear along border edges and there are signs of stirring everywhere. The flower garden is full of promise and potential. Imagination propels us through the coming months, conjuring up the colours and fragrances hidden in emerging shoots and winter-tousled mats. Soon, the impressive noses of crown imperials and the lesser snouts of other spring bulbs push through the cool earth and seem to sniff out the prospects of growing weather. Bleeding hearts, columbines and aconites begin to unfurl their foliage in a slow fan dance, while rough, hairy tufts of Oriental poppies stretch to catch the sun and many other garden dwellers respond, in their own way, to an irresistible urge to grow. </p><p> We have not planted a single thing this spring, but from the time the first snowdrop rings a silent signal, we can look forward to waves of flowers -- just ripples at first -- following each other over the half year, April to September, which we cherish as our growing season. Snowdrops and crocuses give way to daffodils and primroses. These exit a month later, as tulips, bleeding hearts and creeping phlox take the stage against a backdrop of perfumed lilacs. As June bows in, a rainbow of irises fills the garden, fat Oriental poppies pop their furry buds in small explosions of scarlet, and spicy pinks swarm along the border edges. Soon, peonies loll their opulent pink and crimson flowers onto a spread of silver artemisia, and tapered foxgloves spire up behind old-fashioned roses. Lilies that have been inching upward all these weeks finally hang out exotic Turk's-caps -- vibrant orange, wine-dark or soft yellow -above a cloud of baby's-breath. It won't be long, then, before the tall mullein candles flicker among wands of rose loosestrife and yellow day lilies. Showy stonecrop keeps its corner of the garden presentable from the time its succulent silver rosettes emerge until heads of mauve-pink flowers, a rest-stop for passing butterflies, mellow to warm brown, in keeping with the autumn scene.</p></p><h2>Just What I Needed (The Need You Series)</h2><p><b>The second sexy novel in the Need You series, from the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Mastered Series and the Blacktop Cowboys� Series.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Trinity Carlson might be having the worst day ever.

Schultz emphasizes the importance of letting the Scriptures tell their own stories. He makes selective use of the best and latest literature in Old Testament studies, and offers a balanced perspective. Schultz sifts the facts and follows them to their inevitable conclusions. However, when the evidence is not definitive, he exercises caution, presenting his own interpretation as only one of several possible views. Schultz also appraises the impact of recent archaeological and historical findings on the understanding of key portions of the Old Testament.</p><p><em>The Old Testament Speaks</em> contains all the relevant material -- biblical and nonbiblical -- necessary for classroom use or personal study of the Old Testament. Schultz provides outlines that reflect the historical background and summarize the contents of each biblical book, as well as charts and maps to help visualize the biblical narrative. He has also revised and updated the biblio-graphies at the end of each chapter.</p></p><p>Samuel J. Schultz is an emeritus professor of Bible and theology at Wheaton College. He is the author of <em>The Prophets Speak: The Law of Love -- The Essence of Israel's Religion, Deuteronomy: The Gospel of Love, The Gospel of Moses, Leviticus,</em> and numerous articles on biblical subjects.&#34;A positive proclamation of the spirit and purpose of the Old Testament.&#34; -- &#34;Christianity Today&#34;&#34;Few books in the area of Biblical studies have proven themselves to be of such worth and value. What makes this book so attractive is the straightforward clarity and beauty of Schultz&#39;s presentation of the message. He has been able to show the contemporary significance of the Old Testament. All readers of the Old Testament will want to havea copy of &#34;The Old Testament Speaks&#34; handy for their own personal reading pleasure of the wonderful gospel found in the Old Testament.&#34; -- Dr. Walter C. Kaiser Jr., President and Coleman M. Mockler Distinguished Professor of Old Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary&#34;&#34;The Old Testament Speaks&#34; is a book for the thoughtful layman, the preaching pastor, and the classroom instructor. It&#39;s dependable in its facts and interpretations and helpful in its explanations and outlines. Dr. Schultz emphasizes the practical message of the text and carefullybalances solid academics with spiritual insights.&#34; -- Warren W. Wiersbe, author and conference speaker&#34;For thirty years, I have used this book. It is still the best presentation ofthe Old Testament that accepts it as the Word of God. Schultz gives adequate space to archeological finds and extensive coverage in both outline form and narrative, yet it is comprehensive, not overly academic, and very readable for university freshmen and lay people.&#34; -- Dr. Wilbur Glenn Williams, Associate Professor of Biblical Literature and Archaeology, Indiana Wesleyan University</p><h2>The Call of the Wild-Treasury of Illustrated Classics Storybook Collection</h2><p>When Buck is kidnapped, he is sold as a sled dog in a severely cold northern territory. He struggles for his life as he fights fiercely for the bare necessiies. Soon, Buck grows stronger and becomes the leader of his pack. But when he hears the wolves howl, Buck realizes that he must one day answer to the call of the wild. Join Buck on the adventure that changes his life! This easy to read adaptation of the classic novel is guaranteed to hook beginning readers not yet ready to tackle the original.</p><p>&#34;A lively and expressive reading of this riveting story of the far north.&#34;<p> A best-seller from its first publication in 1903, <em>The Call of the Wild</em> tells the story of Buck, a big mongrel dog who is shipped from his comfortable life in California to Alaska, where he must adapt to the harsh life of a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush. The narrative recounts Buck&#x2019;s brutal obedience training, his struggle to meet the demands of human masters, and his rise to the position of lead sled dog as a result of his superior physical and mental qualities. Finally, Buck is free to respond to the &#x201c;call&#x201d; of the wilderness. Over a hundred years after its publication, Jack London&#x2019;s &#x201c;dog story&#x201d; retains the enduring appeal of a classic. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that explores London&#x2019;s life and legacy and the complex scientific and psychological ideas drawn upon by London in writing the story. The appendices include material on the Klondike, Darwin&#x2019;s writings on dogs, other contemporary writings on instinct and atavism, and maps of the regions in which the story takes place. </p></p><h2>The Art of Light and Space</h2><p>Ethereal and evocative, the art of Light and Space pushes the viewer beyond the everyday limits of perception. It takes many different forms and uses many different materials, ranging from natural daylight and scrim to glass, plywood, neon, and fire. It taps into far-ranging ideas and systems of knowledge, including alchemy, Buddhism, aerospace technology, witchcraft, astronomy, physiology, and phenomenology.<br> <br>Written by the foremost authority on the subject and based on more than two decades of research,<i> The Art of Light and Space </i>is the first book to provide an overview of this powerful and increasingly public art form. With rare photographs, extensive artist interviews, and her own insightful observations, Jan Butterfield vividly documents the history of this diverse and sometimes elusive work.<br> <br>Following a useful introduction that succinctly places the art of Light and Space in the larger context of modern art, the book is divided into ten chapters, each focused on one artist: Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Maria Nordman, Douglas Wheeler, Bruce Nauman, Eric Orr, Larry Bell, DeWain Valentine, Susan Kaiser Vogel, and Hap Tivey. Insightful portrait photographs by Jim McHugh open each chapter and capture the quirky individuality of these inexhaustibly creative men and women. The innovative graphic design emphasizes the artists' own words, both in sidebars and in the text, making their voices unusually accessible.<br> <br>No two artists have followed the same path, but in many cases the work has become increasingly approachable in recent years. Architects and urban planners have begun to incorporate Light and Space installations into public spaces ranging from the Old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C., to the new building in Pasadena, California. Corporate, nonprofit, and private collectors have commissioned numerous major works, including a solar fountain in Denver, a tea house in Paris, and a fire-and-steam sculpture on a busy Los Angeles street corner.<br> <br>The processes of creating the works seen here are as intriguing as the final results, and all are illuminated by the text, the illustrations, and the design of this provocative, invaluable volume.<br></p><p><b>Jan Butterfield</b> is currently head of Access, a consulting firm for artists in Santa Monica, California. Previously she was executive director of Lapis Press and public relations director for the Fort Worth Art Museum and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. A well-known art critic, she has contributed to <i>Art in America</i>, <i>Artnews</i>, and many other publications; she is also the author of numerous catalogs.<br> <br> <b>Jim McHugh,</b> who is a contributing photographer with <i>People</i> magazine, lives in Los Angeles and has been photographing artists for the last ten years.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>In the mid-1960s a small cluster of artists in Southern California began intense investigations. Aware of each other but not yet interrelated or counter influenced, each of them began to discard selected truths about art and to build a structure within which new or (for them) more real&#x201d; truths could be examined. This work did not become known to the larger art world for some time, but now nearly thirty years have passed, it can be seen as a major development in the history of modern art.<br> <br>The terms <i>art</i> and <i>object</i> are virtually synonymous, yet for a decade and a half these artists produced essentially no objects. Light and dark, sunlight and shadow, time and space, sound and silence, fire, smoke, scrim, and string were their original materials. Eventually they began to utilize far more complex media and methodologies, and over the years their materials have included di-electricoated glass, luminescent or phosphorescent materials, Plexiglas, polyester resin, cast acrylic, fiberglass, neon, fluorescent lights, high-intensity xenon projectors, and so on. The results could not be easily collected, exhibited, or even transported to a locale other than the one for which they had originally been conceived. In most cases the artist&#x2019;s intent was to offer a tabula rasa on which the percipient could inscribe his or her specific experience. The Mondrian was no longer on the wall instead the viewer was in the Mondrian.<br> <br>Key among the artists making such work are Robert Irwin, Jim Turrell, Doug Wheeler, Maria Norman, Larry Bell, and Eric Orr. There are others such as DeWain Valentine, Bruce Nauman, Hap Tivey, Susan Kaiser Vogel, and Tom Eatherton whose investigations, while not precisely parallel, at times intersect with the concerns of the first group. More recently a new generation has started, with Lita Albuquerque and Peter Erskine. Work by these artists has been variously termed experiential, situational, phenomenal, phenomenological, site-specific, ambient, or simply Light and Space, despite the fact that all of the artists have avoided such designations. The similarity of their investigations in no way indicates cohesiveness; in fact, to understand the work of these artists it is crucial to recognize that they constitute neither a group nor a movement. There is no manifesto. Yet even though they have never banded together, they have given each other strength, and an astonishing amount of each artist&#x2019;s work has been seen by all the others. Their independence and their egos have not crowded out honest admiration for the contributions of their peers.<br> <br>The artists to be discussed here acquired their knowledge through trial and error, weighing this against that and that against something else, until what felt right resulted in what was right. In this sense many of them are as much philosophers as artists. Robert Irwin, for example, has said: Any one of us, when we sit down and ask Why am I here?&#x2019; What do I mean?&#x2019; What is life about?&#x2019; is being a philosopher. That is the whole point about being a philosopher examining your existence in the world, your moment in the world The real beauty of philosophy is the examination of your own moment, your own being in circumstance.&#x201d;<br> <br>This procedure comes close to an illuminating description of phenomenology proposed by Axel Madsen:<br> <br>Phenomenology was a movement trying to understand the way man thinks and to redefine his relations with himself and the world Phenomenology wanted to go back to basics by describing things phenomena without trying to explain or analyze them, and from the narrowed notion of thinking moved forward to a new, more intuitive grasp of our sense of being. Phenomenology meant to stand back and suspend all judgment and to try to grasp things and ideas with a kind of primal intuition.<br> <br>How we see has been a crucial aspect of art since its beginning. Cavemen knew that painterly gestures depicting a head, four legs, and a tail would mean horse&#x201d; if they were put together in a specific way. The invention of one-point perspective in the Renaissance provided illusions of depth for the first time. Three hundred years later the Impressionists&#x2019; application of scientific color theories yielded new sensations of color and movement. The Cubists sought to convey an even more sophisticated visual concept: the simultaneous representation of multiple facets of an object from different points of view.<br> <br>In our own time, changes in attitudes about time and space brought about by the new physics have radically altered our thinking yet again. In addition, an increased comprehension of and tolerance for Eastern philosophies have led to a deeper understanding of humans as metaphysical beings. These expanded attitudes have resulted in an expanded art; it is no longer an art of illusion or even of abstraction but one that is possibly more human than either of them, because it takes shape only through the viewer&#x2019;s directed perception.<br> <br>To comprehend this new art requires examining existing attitudes based on the idea of art as illusion. Centuries of learned logic have encouraged a willing suspension of disbelief: we have learned to accept the illusion because we have been conditioned to do so. And yet it is not simply mathematical perspective, the seeming veracity of the image, or the painterly stroke that appeals to us. It is the search for truth, for a different state of being that causes us to find a given work compelling. It is this reality and not a literal one to which we respond. As Gaston Bachelard has noted, The soul employs reverie to apprehend the poetic image.&#x201d; It is in this state of reverie that the participant in a work of Light and Space slowly lets go of rational, structured reality and slips into an altogether different perceptual state. In this double depth of the dreamer and the world,&#x201d; the <i>presence</i> of light, the <i>sense</i> of color, and the <i>feel</i> of space merge, becoming far more real than any literal representation of them could be.<br> <br>The history of modern art has encompassed a progressive reduction of imagery and of gesture. The Russian Suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich wrote in 1915: Over the past millennia, the artist has striven to approach the depiction of an object as closely as possible, to transmit its essence and meaning; then in our era of cubism, the artist destroyed objects together with their meaning, essence and purpose. A new picture has arisen from their fragments. Objects have vanished like smoke, for the sake of a new culture of art.&#x201d; It seems that Malevich&#x2019;s explorations and those of other Russian artists, such as El Lissitzky, would eventually have led to an art without objects. However, the calamitous October Revolution cut short their breakthrough investigations, and the possibility of a new art of being rather than seeing was swept away with the storming of the Winter Palace.<br> <br>After the Suprematist movement was derailed, it was some time before the original impetus was recaptured in new works of a phenomenal nature. In the intervening years there were numerous handcarts on the main track. Wassily Kandinsky took the journey, and so did Piet Mondrian. Later Ad Reinhardt, The Black Monk,&#x201d; produced a body of work that made clear his comprehension of the route. But it is Suprematism that provides the most important frame of reference for the phenomenal art of Light and Space.<br> <br>At the same time that Malevich and El Lissitzky were proclaiming a new art with metaphysical implications, the de Stijl artists in Holland, led by Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg, were attempting to create a new, universal language of art. Each group was utopian in its beliefs, and each attempted to integrate art into all aspects of life. Out of these attitudes evolved the room environments that are the antecedents, philosophically at least, of many of the Light and Space installations. <br></p><h2>The Matchmaker of Kenmare: A Novel of Ireland</h2><p>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s a legend&#x2014;she had only vague details&#x2014;that all couples who are meant to marry are connected by an invisible silver cord which is wrapped around their ankles at birth, and in time the matchmaking gods pull those cords tighter and tighter and draw the couple slowly toward one another until they meet.&#x201d; So says Miss Kate Begley, Matchmaker of Kenmare, the enigmatic woman Ben MacCarthy meets in the summer of 1943.<br> <br>As World War II rages on, Ben remains haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his wife, the actress Venetia Kelly.

It makes them waterproof.&#x201d;<br><br>She knew a terrific card trick, but she refused to teach it to me. &#x201c;Big hands are for power,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;not trickery.&#x201d;<br><br>At our very first meeting she asked, &#x201c;How can you tell whether an egg is fresh?&#x201d;<br><br>If it doesn&#x2019;t bounce when you drop it? In those days, I had a sardonic inner voice, my only defense mechanism.<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Put it in a pan of cold water with salt, and if the egg rises to the surface it&#x2019;s bad.&#x201d;<br><br>You must have seen a lot of bad eggs, said my secret voice. I think I was afraid of her then.<br><br>She went on, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re hard-boiling an egg, a pinch of salt in the water will stop it cracking.&#x201d;<br><br>A pinch of salt, indeed.<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever want to catch a bird,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;just sprinkle salt on its tail.&#x201d;<br><br>How useful. You just have to get close enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Not too much salt,&#x201d; she added.<br><br>Does it depend on the size of the bird?<br><br>Could she hear what I was thinking? &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;with an ostrich. Ostriches hate salt.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoping to sound tactful, I asked, &#x201c;Are there ostriches here in Kerry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, use your imagination,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re around here all right. But you have to know where to look for them.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded, in confusion more than agreement.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a strong imagination, Ben?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not sure that I trust it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are only two words,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;in which I put my trust. Magic and Faith.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of her grip on me came from the conflict of opposites. Whereas I had always leaned toward the scholarly, she belonged to the demotic. For every line of Horace and Virgil that I savored, she had a snatch of cant, and from the moment we met I began to note many of her sayings and old saws. They still addle my brain; this morning, as I sat down to work, I remembered a fragment from a spelling game that she&#x2019;d learned as a child: &#x201c;Mrs. D. Mrs. I. Mrs. F-F-I. Mrs. C. Mrs. U. Mrs. L-T-Y.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Patience,&#x201d; she murmured another day, &#x201c;is the Mother of Science.&#x201d;<br><br>I would swear that she often spoke in uppercase letters.<br><br>Since she rarely left her stony Atlantic headland, her knowledge of the world must have come from some popular encyclopedia of arcane and unconnected facts. Giraffes, ostriches, and eggs&#x2014;they formed no more than an introduction. She knew about the lives of ants; how to gut a fish using a sharp stick and your thumb; training a cat to play dead; the healing properties of sour milk; the fact that honey is the only food that never goes off; where to find a stone that retains heat for twelve hours; how cloves grow; the number of bones in an eagle&#x2019;s wing; why a cow has four stomachs; how long to boil the tar for caulking the hull of a boat. She was a walking, talking library of vernacular knowledge.<br><br>She loved music, but she couldn&#x2019;t carry a tune in a bucket. Her eye had the familiar speed of a child raised in the countryside&#x2014;she could identify a bird thousands of yards away. She had a sense of color so strong that she could tell one shade of black from another. Her capacity to quote from Shakespeare suggested wide reading of him&#x2014;even if some pages seemed to have been missing from her edition of the Collected Works.<br><br>Moreover, she had one specific gift that I still can&#x2019;t fathom. It has never ceased to puzzle me; she used it a number of times in my company, always with astonishing results, and if it can&#x2019;t be called &#x201c;magic,&#x201d; well, nothing can: She could find people by looking at a map. And we shall come to those moments when I saw her pull this stunt, trick, sleight of mind, or whatever it should be called.<br><br>Although she spoke three and a half languages, she had never been abroad. And however delightful in its innocence, the part of her that remained in her own homestead also made me wince, with its homespun charm, its greeting-card sentiment.<br><br>&#x201c;Ben, do you know what the difference is between Friendship and Love? Friendship is the photograph, Love is the oil painting.&#x201d; And she uttered it in the declarative way she had of saying things that made me hesitate to contradict her.<br><br>Her words often sounded so shallow that I dismissed them, and later found to my displeasure that her mushy sentiments had lingered and were staggering around in my mind like a drunk at a wedding. In that sense, she possessed in trumps the strange potency of cheap music, and I know that I caught some of it from her.<br><br>However, from inside all that phrase-and-fable stuff, she served up a philosophy that had an alluring power. For example, she brought into my life a belief in something that she called &#x201c;Referred Passion&#x201d;; I even lived by it for a time.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what I mean by &#x2018;Referred Passion&#x2019;?&#x201d; she said one day about a year into our relationship. And, as usual, not waiting for my hopeless stab at a reply, she went on. &#x201c;Do you know what a referred pain is?&#x201d;<br><br>Is it when I feel so stupid that I could kick myself?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your shoulder is injured, but you feel it in your chest. Or you&#x2019;ve hurt your spine, but your hip is carrying the ache. That&#x2019;s referred pain. Well, Referred Passion is when you&#x2019;re in love with one person, but you fiercely embrace another. That&#x2019;s us,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me and you. Friendship is a choice,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Love isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>What else can I tell you about her? She had a phenomenal passion for handkerchiefs. She kept her hair tucked behind an ear like Rita Hayworth. She taught me the words of bawdy old country rhymes, most of them too salty to repeat here. Also, she had the most peculiar recipes for things.<br><br>&#x201c;If you have the hiccups,&#x201d; she told me one day, &#x201c;bend down, put your hands on the floor, and look back between your legs at the sun.&#x201d;<br><br>My inner voice said, Is that all you&#x2019;ll be able to see?&#x2014;but I asked her, &#x201c;And what if it&#x2019;s the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re in worse trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>And I was&#x2014;but I never picked up the warnings.<br><br>As I sat down to write this memoir, I had an opening paragraph in mind; here it is:<br><br>I wish I could tell you about the greatest friendship of my life; I wish I could tell you how it developed beyond friendship into something for which I have no definition, no terminology. But the moment I begin to tell it (and I must: I&#x2019;m mortally committed to telling this tale before I die), I know that I&#x2019;ll enter what I call the &#x201c;Regret Cycle,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;What If Cycle,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;If Only Cycle,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;ll end up nowhere again.<br><br>As you can see, I abandoned those opening sentences, and the direction they proposed&#x2014;yet I&#x2019;m nevertheless going to write it all down for you. I&#x2019;m old enough now to deal with the regrets, the what-ifs, and if-onlys, and whatever the subjective faults you may find in this remembrance, at least I can describe how I, who knew little about anything beyond my own narrow concerns, learned to become a true and deep friend to someone. It may prove important to you one day. To the both of you.<br><br>She, of course, was the one who taught me this magnificent skill&#x2014;as she taught me something else extraordinary, the greatest single lesson of my life: She taught me what blind faith looks like. And blind faith is why I&#x2019;m writing this account of her life, and how it affected me.<br><br>Kate Begley was her name, and she was known as the Matchmaker of Kenmare long before I met her. She and her grandmother shared the title, and Kate was as pretty as a pinup. I was twenty-nine, she was twenty-five when I met her, and she had a grin like a boy&#x2019;s.<br><br>See? See what&#x2019;s happening to me? Pretty as a pinup; and a grin like a boy&#x2019;s&#x2014;the moment I begin to describe her, all these decades later, I become sentimental about her, and I fall into language that I would never use in my ordinary life.<br><br>I who for years wrote uncluttered and austere reports of ancient countryside traditions, I who studied with joy the most powerful scholars of old Europe, I who pride myself on my unadorned simplicity of purpose&#x2014;here I am, forced back into her way of thinking. And I squirm, because at these moments her greeting-card remarks will flood through me again like a maudlin old song. I&#x2019;ve just heard one of those corny echoes: &#x201c;You have to believe me, Ben,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Love is not a decision. But Friendship is.&#x201d;<br><br>Why am I telling you all this? You&#x2019;ll see why. You&#x2019;ll see how she affected my life, and you&#x2019;ll grasp the implications of that effect upon all of us whom this memoir concerns. You&#x2019;ll see how she was the one who made the determinations; where we would go, no matter how dangerous; what we might attempt, no matter how bizarre; and yes, she decided too the balance of love and friendship between us.<br><br>I followed, and she led me into trouble so deep that my own father wouldn&#x2019;t have found me.

An ordained minister, he is a frequent leader of workshops and seminars on the relationship between Christianity and Eastern religions."Not only have my incoming students exhibited little sense of what it means to assert that Christians are historically monotheists (as opposed, say, to deists, pantheists, or monists), but their initial comments about God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit (much less the Trinity) have been so vague and superficial (and often purely sentimental) as to reflect little real understanding. Even such distinctive and indeed axial Christian doctrines as Sin, Grace, Incarnation, and Atonement are at worst barely recognized and at best completely unexamined, dimly grasped, and unrelated to one another in any consistent way. Consequently, any profession of faith that my students might make or notion of salvation that they might harbor is groundless, free-floating, and without context -- theological, existential, psychological, or sociological. <p>"If my thousands of students over the years are at all representative of the larger population, and I believe that they are, I must conclude that the vast majority of Christians today simply don't know nearly as much about their professed religion as they should; or, to put it more strongly, they are pervasively and persistently ignorant about the very faith they claim to embrace. Indeed, it is not uncommon for students in one of my college courses, after weeks of exposure to information about the scripture, theology, and historical development of Christianity, to wonder silently and sometimes inquire aloud why no one has ever told them this important 'stuff' before."</p></p><h2>Tonfa: Karate Weapon of Self-Defense</h2><p>Though neither as flashy nor as glamorous as the nunchaku, the tonfa is an essential tool in the kobudo tradition of self-defense.

The history is told through personal stories and firsthand accounts of the movement&#x2019;s key events, like the 1950s &#x201c;Lavender Scare,&#x201d; the Stonewall Inn uprising, and the AIDS crisis. Kids will learn about civil rights mavericks, like Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, founder of the first gay rights organization; Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who turned the Daughters of Bilitis from a lesbian social club into a powerhouse for LGBT freedom; Christine Jorgensen, the nation&#x2019;s first famous transgender; and Harvey Milk, the first out candidate to win a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Also chronicled are the historic contributions of famous LGBT individuals, from General von Steuben and Alan Turing to Jane Addams and Bayard Rustin, among others. This up-to-date history includes the landmark Supreme Court decision making marriage equality the law of the land. Twenty-one activities enliven the history and demonstrate the spirited ways the LGBT community has pushed for positive social change.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kids can: write a free verse poem like Walt Whitman; learn &#x201c;The Madison&#x201d; line dance; remember a loved one with a quilt panel; perform a monologue from <i>The Laramie Project; </i>make up a song parody; and much more.</p><p><b>Jerome Pohlen</b>&nbsp;is a former elementary school science teacher, an engineer,&nbsp;an editor, and the author of&nbsp;<i>Albert Einstein and Relativity for Kids</i>, a 2013 VOYA Nonfiction Honor List title.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Tackling everything from Sappho, the Daughters of Bilitis, and the Lavender Menace to Dan Savage, Gladys Bentley, and Ellen DeGeneres, this title offers a comprehensive view of LGBTQ history. While the topic is often framed through the lens of marriage rights, this book provides a multifaceted perspective, emphasizing gay and lesbian figures' places in history. Readers learn that Louisa May Alcott, Maurice Sendak, Marlene Dietrich, Bayard Rustin, and Alan Turing were all members of the LGBTQ community, though many of them were not "out." Readers also gain an understanding of the scope of LGBTQ erasure that has occurred from Pohlen's discussion of how in Emily Dickinson's love poems the words she and her were changed to he and her. While many have whitewashed LGBTQ history, Pohlen discusses two transgender individuals of color who were present at Stonewall (both were teens at the time), Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. In addition, Pohlen emphasizes that while the Stonewall Riots were an important turning point in American history, they were not the only time that the queer community has stood up for its rights. The text is upbeat, conversational, and often humorous in tone. Smattered with compelling photographs, biographical sidebars, and interactive activities (of varying quality), this vital and inclusive history fleshes out the LGBTQ education readers have long been denied, bringing it to light and giving it the attention it deserves.

Who helped turn the front porch into an American institution? Which immigrants built saunas to recall Old World traditions? Where did we get neat, whitewashed row houses, barn paintings and stuccoed arches that now tell us where to find tacos and tortillas? All of these pieces in America&#39;s architectural mosaic came from the varied and industrious ethnic groups that built America. Native peoples, settlers before the Revolution and 19th-century immigrants each contributed their own building patterns to help create what we call American architecture. But each ethnic tradition was changed by the experience of building in America -- adapted to new terrains and materials, different climates, existing forms and styles. In the process, a distinctive new architecture developed, one whose multifaceted origins can be traced just as clearly as can ethnic customs in language and food. America&#39;s Architectural Roots is the first book to explore the ethnic derivations of American buildings with such a broad scope. The contributions of 22 groups are highlighted in this fascinating overview that provides an important new way of looking at the buildings that surround us.

As the author shows, all the navigator needs in the way of equipment is a relatively inexpensive sextant - specific recommendations are given - and a reasonably accurate timepiece.

(The somewhat confusing title is from a line in <i>Zorba the Greek</i> in which the title character refers to the ups and downs of family life as "the full catastrophe.") But this book is also a terrific introduction for anyone who has considered meditating but was afraid it would be too difficult or would include religious practices they found foreign. Kabat-Zinn focuses on "mindfulness," a concept that involves living in the moment, paying attention, and simply "being" rather than "doing." While you can practice anything "mindfully," from taking a walk to cleaning your house, Kabat-Zinn presents several meditation techniques that focus the attention most clearly, whether it's on a simple phrase, your breathing, or various parts of your body. The book goes into detail about how hospital patients have either improved their health or simply come to feel better <i>despite</i> their illness by using these techniques, but these meditations can help anyone deal with stress and gain a calmer outlook on life. "When we use the word <i>healing</i> to describe the experiences of people in the stress clinic, what we mean above all is that they are undergoing a profound transformation of view," Kabat-Zinn writes. "Out of this shift in perspective comes an ability to act with greater balance and inner security in the world." <i>--Ben Kallen</i>Featured on Bill Moyer's PBS special <i>Healing And The Mind</i>, this practical guide to mindfulness, meditation and healing from the author of the bestselling <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are</i> is a classic in the field of alternative medicine.</p><h2>The Letters of Allen Ginsberg</h2><p>Allen Ginsberg (1926&#x2013;1997) was one of twentieth-century literature's most prolific letter-writers.

Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Neal Cassady, Lionel Trilling, Charles Olson, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Philip Whalen, Peter Orlovsky, Philip Glass, Arthur Miller, Ken Kesey, and hundreds of others.<p>Through his letter writing, Ginsberg coordinated the efforts of his literary circle and kept everyone informed about what everyone else was doing. He also preached the gospel of the Beat movement by addressing political and social issues in countless letters to publishers, editors, and the news media, devising an entirely new way to educate readers and disseminate information.

Dearborn is the author of MAILER: A BIOGRAPHY, as well as biographies of Henry Miller, John Dewey and Anzia Yezierska, and Louise Bryant. Dearborn holds a doctorate in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University, where she was a Mellon Fellow in the Humanities. Dearborn currently resides in New York.Escaping what she saw as her bourgeois existence as the wife of an Oregon dentist, Louise Bryant (1885-1936) ran off to New York City's Greenwich Village with radical journalist John Reed, who became her second husband. They preached and practiced free love, although her affair with Eugene O'Neill led to explosive quarrels. In revolutionary Russia, while Reed wrote Ten Days That Shook the World, Bryant produced Six Red Months in Russia, a highly sympathetic account of the Bolshevik coup and the communist attempt to mold a new society. Reed died in Moscow in 1920, and four years later, Bryant, a leading Hearst reporter, married William Bullitt, formerly President Wilson's assistant secretary of state. Their move to Paris introduced Bryant to a lesbian subculture, and her affair with English sculptor Gwen Le Gallienne led to a bitter divorce in 1930, with Bryant denied custody of her daughter, Anne. Bryant's long, tragic decline was marked by heavy drinking, paranoia, mental confusion and weight gain, all of which are associated with Dercum's disease, a rare disorder with which she was diagnosed in 1928. Dearborn (The Happiest Man Alive: A Biography of Henry Miller) is much too uncritical of Bryant's role as cheerleader for the Bolshevik cause, and she seems caught up in the romantic saga of her subject's life. Even so, this is a vivid biography of a charismatic woman.

The book contains 55 design ideas.</p><p>Everything old is new again: Marbling, a skill traced to fifteenth-century Turkey, is today applied to paintings, furniture, walls, clothes, and other once-plain surfaces. This mother-and-daughter team have produced a pattern book intended for the serious crafter, since how-to-start directions are omitted. And even though a glossary precedes the 55 patterns, little information is included for the novice. The motifs are divided into four sections, each involving a different method of placing paint in the bath or combing through the colors or both to create chevron, swirl, stone, and other effects. An 11-page gallery demonstrates how other artists have used marbling. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974-2001)</h2><p>The Eagles are the bestselling, and arguably the tightest-lipped, American group ever. Now band member and guitarist Don Felder finally breaks the Eagles&#x2019; years of public silence to take fans behind the scenes. He shares every part of the band&#x2019;s wild ride, from the pressure-packed recording studios and trashed hotel rooms to the tension-filled courtrooms, and from the joy of writing powerful new songs to the magic of performing in huge arenas packed with roaring fans.</p><p>When guitarist Don "Fingers" Felder was invited to join the already platinum-selling Eagles in 1974, he had no idea what sort of rock-and-roll heaven and show-business hell he was about to enter-- -or how hard it would become to tell one from the other. For the next twenty-seven years, Felder found himself deeply involved in a musical career that was musically thrilling, emotionally exhausting, and surprisingly dangerous. <p>In Heaven and Hell, Felder shares this remarkable journey with a firsthand look at his tempestuous years with the Eagles. Even as he, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Randy Meisner, Bernie Leadon, and, later, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit became America's most popular and successful rock band, selling tens of millions of records, Felder reveals that greed, jealousy, and creative differences constantly threatened to tear the Eagles apart. </p><p>From one sold-out arena to the next, some members of the Eagles blazed a trail of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll that became as legendary as their music. Felder explains how the famous E3 (third encore) parties, which began as spontaneous, raucous backstage binges, evolved into highly organized orgies, with roadies recruiting gorgeous women from the audience to be chauffeured to lavish hotel suites, where nothing was off limits. </p><p>Even further behind the scenes, he reveals the grim test of wills between Leadon, Felder's friend since his impoverished boyhood in Gainesville, Florida, and the duo of Frey and Henley. Despite Felder's attempts to mediate this conflict, it would not be resolved until a tense meeting that very nearly came to blows, which ended when Leadon stormed out of the room, never to return to the band. </p><p>Felder alsooffers a rare glimpse into the creative melting pot that produced such great Eagles hits as "Life in the Fast Lane," "Hotel California," "Victim of Love," and many others. The writing of these songs often involved the entire band, as well as non-band members, such as well-known Eagles collaborator J. D. Souther, Bob Seger, and others. Frequently beginning as a simple guitar lick or a vague idea, these songs took shape through a fascinating process of free association and collaboration, yet, says Felder, even these exciting moments led to friction and bickering. </p><p>Filled with hilarious true stories of rock stars on the road, including Felder's first meeting with Keith Richards, who was passed out on a bathroom floor at the time, and Joe Walsh's genius for practical jokes, Heaven and Hell is the book Eagles fans have been waiting for.</p><b>The inside story can finally be revealed</b><p>The Eagles are the bestselling, and arguably the tightest-lipped, American group ever, and <i>Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971&#x2013;1975</i> is the bestselling album of all time in the United States. Through breakup and comeback, arguments and lawsuits, their popularity has continued to soar for more than three decades. Now band member and guitarist Don Felder finally breaks the Eagles' years of public silence to take fans behind the scenes&#x2014;where drugs, greed, and endless acrimony threatened to break up the band almost daily.</p><p>In <i>Heaven and Hell</i>, Felder shares every part of the band's wild ride, from the pressure-packed recording studios and trashed hotel rooms to the tension-filled courtrooms where he, Glenn Frey, and Don Henley had their ultimate confrontation. Yet Felder also remembers the joy of writing powerful new songs with his bandmates and the magic of performing in huge arenas packed with roaring fans. Offering even-handed and perceptive portraits of every member of the Eagles, <i>Heaven and Hell</i> is a thrilling and thoughtful, raucous and bittersweet tale about the love of music and the price of fame.</p></p><h2>Theatre Of The World</h2><p>Literary Criticism Theater Theatre Ancient Appreciation Argument Bibliography Biography Classicist Classics Composition Critic Critique Deconstruction Epic Examination Heroic Interpretation Literature Modern Philosophy Poem Poetic Works Poetry Review Reviewing Semiotics Theory</p><p></p><h2>Quiltmaking Tips and Techniques: Over 1000 Creative Ideas to Make Your Quiltmaking Quicker, Easier, and a Lot More Fun</h2><p>Covers workspaces, fabric selection, patterns, applique, and quilting</p><p><p>"This book gets an A+!"--Virginia Robertson, Teacher, Quilt Designer, Owner of The Osage County Quilt Factory</p><p>"If I had to choose one book for my library, this would be the one!"--Pat Yamin, Teacher, Quilt Designer, Owner of Come Quilt With Me</p><p>"A quilter's delight!

Among her nine wine books are the bestselling <b>Oxford Companion to Wine</b> (editor) and <b>Jancis Robinson?s Wine Course</b>, the basis of a five-hour 1996 PBS-TV series. She lives in London.In case you were interested, here's everything you could ever possibly want to know about Robinson's (Oxford Companion to Wine) career trajectory. Robinson, who has been a fixture in the wine writing establishment for 25 years, teeters precariously, wanting her readers to know that she is both a wine connoisseur--exquisitively sensitive to the historical, geographical, and sociological contexts of wine--and a populist rabble-rouser, bucking received opinion as she champions the wine-drinking pleasures open to Everyman. She quaffs Grands Echezeaux, La Tache, Romanee-Conti, 1847 Yquems, and 1787 Branne Moutons, has ``swashbuckling'' Harold Evans as her editor at London's Sunday Times, and hobnobs with Hugh Johnson and Edmund Penning-Rowsell, But she also starts up the Drinker's Digest, an opinionated and iconoclastic newsletter dedicated to the principle of the best wine for the best price. Readers will learn the holdings in her cellar, her peregrinations through the wine-trade publications, the many personalities she meets, the astonishing meals she enjoys, and will share her each and every momentous occasion (``I shall never forget my first formal wine tasting''; ``My most embarrassing trial by tasting took place. . . . ``, etc.). She gets serious now and then--discussing the pros and cons of blind tastings, detailing how Robert M. Parker Jr. has gained his mind-boggling sway over the wine world--but for the most part, this reads like a gossip column that can't turn a decent sentence (``The others are that there are anyway enough people who love Tertre, for it is probably the only Saint-Emilion other than the top-ranking Ausone and Cheval Blanc''). Despite its moments, this autobiography is clunky, desperately self-promoting, and, at best, premature. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As a 23-year-old bank clerk, Eastman bought his first camera and began simplifying the cumbersome and messy wet-plate process. With only two years' experience, he patented a dry-plate coating machine and began selling photographic plates. Soon, the business was doing so well that he quit his job at the bank and started his own company.</p><p>Eastman's success was based in part on his own inventions, but even more on his ability to raise capital, recruit technically skilled employees, sell his own products, and outmaneuver his competitors. In this revealing and informative new biography, Brayer shows us how such key innovations as roll film and the light, hand-held camera helped the Eastman Kodak Company dominate the world market.</p><p>More importantly, Brayer draws a vivid portrait of the man behind the money. Eastman worked hard at keeping out of the limelight and even insisted that his donations be kept anonymous, prompting the Boston Globe to call him "America's most modest and least- known millionaire." His aggressive business personality was a sharp contrast to his personal life: Eastman once joked that it was his goal to take two six-month vacations in a year. He would regularly forsake the office to bicycle around Europe or ride a stagecoach through the snowy trails of Yellowstone Park. He was an art lover, who once bartered 60 shares of Kodak stock in the 1890s for a painting he felt he must have, and a classical music enthusiast, who built a school for the training of virtuosos.</p><p>Despite his retirement in 1925, Eastman showed little sign of slowing down. Making money had been interesting, but putting money to work became more so. In the 1920s he designed a special camera for use in orthodontia and established elaborate dental clinics for needy children in Rochester, London, Paris, Brussels, Stockholm, and Rome. He oversaw the building of the Eastman Theatre and the Eastman School of Music. His contributions built a new campus for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a new medical school for the University of Rochester. Finally, he became the largest contributor to the education of African Americans during the 1920s and the Tuskeegee Institute's most important benefactor.</p></p><p>The innovative founder of the Eastman Kodak Company was not generally known for his thirst for adventure, his love of art and classical music, or his philanthropic activities, yet these were all important aspects of the man. George Eastman (1854-1932) was a complicated individual who lived most of his long, industrious life out of the public eye; his private affairs both admirable and dubious are now out in the open, thanks to this scholarly and scrupulous biography. Eastman is revealed as cold, shrewd, modest, and surprisingly generous in this colorful portrait. The text is appropriately enhanced by a number of rare photographs.<p>Elizabeth Brayer has been Eastman historian at George Eastman House, International Museum of Photography and Film. She writes about the history of central and western New York state.</p></p><h2>The Bed Book</h2><p>Describes various beds that are much more interesting than beds for sleeping, such as a jet-propelled bed, snack bed, pocket-size bed, and bounceable bed.</p><p>Contains a catalogue of desirable beds, ranging from an elephant bed for hot weather to a tank bed which can travel anywhere and a bouncable bed - surely the most desirable of all - which can bounce you &#34;over the moon to Timbuktoo&#34;.

All 34 paintings are here (including what we know of the lost ones), many with huge and immensely illuminating details, plus 663 drawings. The reproductions are stunning, on paper sturdy enough to serve as wings on some of the flying machines depicted on pages 644 to 671. The precision of the images amazes: the delicate petals fingered by the larger-than-life-size baby Jesus in <i>Madonna of the Carnation</i>; the wailing, dismembered victims of Leonardo's scary scythed chariots; Mary's transparent drapery in the <i>Annunciation</i>; the bands of sunlight streaking each swirling curl of Ginevra de Benci; Mona Lisa's gossamer veil and intricately embroidered gown; even, unless my eyes deceive me, one of the fingerprints Leonardo famously left while daubing paint by hand.<p></p> The text by Frank Zollner (and Johannes Nathan, who discusses the drawings) teases out meanings and sketches historical context without overloading his scholarly brush. Without it, one might have overlooked the dim crucifix on which St. Jerome fixes his blazing gaze, and quite misunderstood the sexist Hippocratic delusions that inform <i>The Sexual Act in Vertical Section</i>: "A tube-like duct leads from the woman&#x2019;s breasts to her womb, while the male organ is directly linked not only to the testicles but also...to the brain." (Zollner&#x2019;s discussion of the erotic subtext of some of the artwork suggests that Leonardo's male passion was not necessarily so rational.) The brief accounts of Leonardo's esthetic combat with Michelangelo and Raphael suggest that you don't need a scythed chariot to cut off an opponent at the knees. The famous quotes by everyone from Nietzsche to Warhol are well selected, especially Freud diagnosing Leonardo's genius as residing in his childlike sense of play. That's a key to the spirit of this book: it's more fun than a week in the Louvre. <i>&#x2013;Tim Appelo</i>Johannes Nathan studied art history at New York University and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995 with a dissertation on the working methods of Leonardo da Vinci. He is the author of numerous art publications, director of Nathan Fine Art (Berlin and Z�rich) and a teacher of art history at the Technische Universit�t, Berlin.<br><br>Frank Z�llner wrote his doctoral thesis on motifs originating from Antiquity in the history of art and architecture of the Medieval and Renaissance periods (1987). He is also the author of a postdoctoral treatise on motion and expression in the art of Leonardo da Vinci, published in 2010. He has published numerous works on Renaissance art and art theory, and on 20th-century art. Since 1996 he has been Professor of Medieval and Modern Art at the University of Leipzig.

Not only is the feisty heroine from Balsa City, Ga., back for her sixth outing, but her love life gets a real work out. After a six-week fling, Jo Beth and Sheriff Hank Cribbs decide that their hot but volatile relationship is too costly to continue. Besides, a handsome hunk's in town on a sad occasion and Jo Beth thinks she may be of some help. And then there's Jimmy Joe Lane, a swamp rat and inveterate prison escapee who's developed a crush on Jo Beth. His many kin regard Jimmy Joe, who's managed to parlay an original 90-day sentence into a debt of more than 40 years, as something of a legend. When Jimmy Joe makes his nearly inevitable next jailbreak, he can't wait to begin turning his fantasies about Jo Beth into reality. Lanier mines the situation's comic possibilities nicely without straying into farce and, as usual, turns an expert eye on bloodhounds and their care and training in this warmly entertaining concoction.

His analysis of the plight of America's youth is particularly heartbreaking. If we have a shred of moral fibre left in our beings, Henry Giroux sounds the trumpet to awaken it to action to restore to the nation a civic soul."--Dennis J. Kucinich, former US Congressman and Presidential candidate</p><p>"Giroux lays out a blistering critique of an America governed by the tenets of a market economy. . . . He cites French philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman's concept of the 'disimagination machine' to describe a culture and pedagogical philosophy that short-circuits citizens' ability to think critically, leaving the generation now reaching adulthood unprepared for an 'inhospitable' world. Picking apart the current malaise of 21st-century digital disorder, Giroux describes a world in which citizenship is replaced by consumerism and the functions of engaged governance are explicitly beholden to corporations."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>In a series of essays that explore the intersections of politics, popular culture, and new forms of social control in American society, Henry A. Giroux explores how state and corporate interests have coalesced to restrict civil rights, privatize what's left of public institutions, and diminish our collective capacity to participate as engaged citizens of a democracy.</p><p>From the normalization of mass surveillance, lockdown drills, and a state of constant war, to corporate bailouts paired with public austerity programs that further impoverish struggling families and communities, Giroux looks to flashpoints in current events to reveal how the forces of government and business are at work to generate a culture of mass forgetfulness, obedience and conformity. In <i>The Violence of Organized Forgetting</i>, Giroux deconstructs the stories created to control us while championing the indomitable power of education, democracy, and hope.</p><p>Henry A.

However, he remains optimistic in his affirmation of radical humanity, determined as he is to relate himself to a fair and caring world unblemished by anti-democratic political depravity."--Shelley Walia, <i>Frontline</i></p><br></p><p>Henry A.

The book is divided into three sections - terms and their definitions, an outline of literary history and an index of names. The terms have been updated to reflect modern and ethnic usages.</p><p>This comprehensive text is the definitive reference text on literature and literary criticism in English. The text itself is an alphabetical listing of the terms that pertain to literature in English. Now in its seventh edition, it has been used by more than one million students.Preface to the Seventh Edition o For more than ten years now, I have given part of every day to the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of this handbook, and, even before the seventh is technically finished, I have started to make notes for the eighth. I have little to add to what has been said in earlier prefaces, except to report something I had not expected: this kind of work has been more to me and of me than creative writing. One of the improvements in the world since the first edition sixty years ago, as far as I am concerned, is such expansion and relaxation of literary studies that we may now pay to works of biography, history, philosophy, and social science the same kind of critical attention that was once austerely reserved for poems, plays, and novels. And, since the idea of &#34;text&#34; has been enlarged much beyond the realm of print, one may look at an objective work, like this handbook, as a personal text not too different from a poem. For what it may be worth, I can testify, after twenty-five years of publishing books of poetry, that verse is of my life a thing apart, but that the making of reference works like anthologies and handbooks is my whole existence. That exaggerates things somewhat, but it registers my sense of being on even in my dreams. With every conscious experience of a text television production, magazine, bumper sticker, tattoo, overheard conversationI can feel the gears grinding. And probably even more so with casual and unconscious experiences. My wife asks, &#34;Is that a spoof?&#34; and I immediately wonder if the handbook needs an entry for &#34;spoof.&#34; TV Guide calls things &#34;soap noir&#34; (Twin Peaks) or &#34;gender-bender&#34; (a film in which a break-dancer with ESP solves a murder), and the machinery starts to hum.

Elkins totally avoids the sin of sloth represented by some mystery writers who habitually underresearch their topics. Elkins always presents a rich buffet of fascinating scientific facts, and this time his table overflows with information about the Amazon's wildlife and, even more intriguingly, its plant life, long used by natives as medicine and now studied by medical ethnobotanists. Elkins, generous with background, is a bit too generous with setup: by the time Professor Oliver and the research botanists actually get to the Amazon, readers may be tired of the overly long, and-then-there-were-none-style introductions to each character. Once underway on the Amazon, however, things quickly pick up, as a shrunken head, carried by a spear, lands on deck, and Oliver's detective skills are called into play when one of the botanists is murdered.

His first commercial release, GET RICH OR DIE TRYING, was the highest selling debut album of all times with sales of 400,000 in its first three months.Starred Review. The rap superstar known as 50 Cent was born Curtis James Jackson III in 1976. His mother, a smalltime drug dealer, was murdered when he was eight, but that didn't stop him from pursuing her profession. 50 Cent is unflinchingly honest about his mother, his drug past and just about everything else in this raw, literate memoir chronicling his rise from Jamaica, Queens, to the top of the Billboard charts. In his neighborhood, recalls 50 Cent, the only people with money were the drug dealers: "They were my role models." By 11, he'd made his first sale. Over the next decade, 50 Cent evolved from a hustler selling capsules of crack cocaine ("pieces") to a kingpin purchasing by the kilo ("weight"). With money came girls, clothes, cars&#x2014;and trouble. 50 Cent describes spraying bullets at rivals, outrunning police on his motorcycle and waking up to a drug raid on his house. He avoided jail by serving time in a boot camp&#x2013;style incarceration center, which did nothing but turn him into a "stronger, meaner, and more focused criminal." His big break into music came through a chance meeting with Jam Master Jay (of Run-DMC). Yet even while trying to break into the business, 50 Cent couldn't leave his past behind, wearing bulletproof vests to meetings with record executives and slipping back into the drug trade when his career didn't take off immediately. Fans will discover the origins of 50 Cent's famous feud with Ja Rule; they'll also get more details about the notorious 2000 shooting that left him with nine bullet holes in his body. Opinionated, unrepentant and unabashedly self-promoting, 50 Cent's memoir celebrates the rapper's peculiar brand of the American Dream (and the title of his breakthrough album): <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But this Christmas, Pap is far away in New York City, digging a hole for something called the subway, and his family is missing him something awful. Pap aches to be home, but the heartless foremen of his dig site have decided there will be no break, not even for Christmas. It looks like it's going to be one lonely holiday for everyone . . . until young Saraleen and Royce send their pap a gift that may just inspire a Christmas miracle.<br> The recipient of a Coretta Scott King Author Honor and a two-time Caldecott Honor illustrator have created a warm and magical holiday classic about the power of love, complete with the recipe for Mim's Christmas jam.<br></p><p><b>ANDREA DAVIS PINKNEY</b> is an acclaimed author whose awards include a Coretta Scott King Author Honor for <i>Let It Shine: Stories of Black Women Freedom Fighters</i>.

The children miss him, so Mim suggests they make him a batch of belly-hum jam, a recipe passed down from ancestors who were slaves. Its main ingredients, she tells the children, are love and pride in their family. Pap is nearly reprimanded by his foremen when he tries to share his jam with other workers, but he's rescued by the sweet smell of the belly-hum. After just one taste of the jam, the foremen stop the work and send everyone home for Christmas. This heartwarming tale not only reveals some history about one of the country's greatest engineering marvels but also portrays the essence of Christmas spirit. Brian Pinkney's trademark scratchboard illustrations are a fitting nostalgic accompaniment, and there's a clear, concise preface that supplies background about the subway's construction.

But, as the company continued to grow and diversify in the 20th century, problems began to emerge: management tended to be rigid and inept in cutting costs; after a background of enmity toward labor, the company did an about-face and signed contracts that granted union workers extremely costly benefits; executives failed to forecast how the cyclical nature of the agricultural machine business might affect sales; the firm became overextended with debts. In the early 1980s, a combination of a recession, surplus farm commodities and a strong U.S. dollar brought disaster. Harvester barely escaped bankruptcy, and now a smaller, leaner, reorganized company is attempting a comeback. Marsh has done a fine job of telling this story, one of great interest beyond the business community. November 8<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is the story of the rise and fall of International Harvester, from 1831, when Cyrus McCormick patented his reaper, to 1985, by which time Harvest er was only in the truck and engine business. The last 10 to 15 years are highlighted, but enough earlier history is given so that the reader can under stand the mistakes that led to the virtual collapse of one of America's largest manufacturers. International's failure was caused by a multitude of factors. Marsh documents these well but pays special attention to how both Harvest er's consultants and the new manage ment misread the cultural and historical relationships within the company. Marsh's book is well-researched and as readable as a novel. Highly recom mended for all business collections. Michael D. Kathman, St. John's Univ.

From the pauper&#x2019;s bowl to elite tables, from early fad diets to the perceived moral superiority of certain foods, and from regional folk remedies to luxuries such as lampreys, Woolgar illuminates desire, necessity, daily rituals, and pleasure across four centuries.</p><p><b>C.

But for the people whose homes and districts were bulldozed, the urban renewal projects that swept America starting in 1949 were nothing short of assault. Vibrant city blocks&#x2014;places rich in history&#x2014;were reduced to garbage-strewn vacant lots. When a neighborhood is destroyed its inhabitants suffer &#x201c;root shock&#x201d;: a traumatic stress reaction related to the destruction of one&#x2019;s emotional ecosystem. The ripple effects of root shock have an impact on entire communities that can last for decades. <br><br>In this groundbreaking and ultimately hopeful book, Dr. Mindy Fullilove examines root shock through the story of urban renewal and its effect on the African American community. Between 1949 and 1973 this federal program, spearheaded by business and real estate interests, destroyed 1,600 African American neighborhoods in cities across the United States. But urban renewal didn&#x2019;t just disrupt the black community. The anger it caused led to riots that sent whites fleeing for the suburbs, stripping them of their own sense of place. And it left big gashes in the centers of U.S. cities that are only now slowly being repaired. <br><br>Focusing on three very different urban settings&#x2014;the Hill District of Pittsburgh, the Central Ward in Newark, and the small Virginia city of Roanoke&#x2014;Dr. Fullilove argues powerfully that the twenty-first century will be one of displacement and of continual demolition and reconstruction. Acknowledging the damage caused by root shock is crucial to coping with its human toll and building a road to recovery.<br><br>Astonishing in its revelations, unsparing in its conclusions, <i>Root Shock </i>should be read by anyone who cares about the quality of life in American cities&#x2014;and the dignity of those who reside there.</p><p><b>Mindy Fullilove, M.D.</b>, a professor of clinical psychiatry and public health at Columbia University, has done pioneering research on the effects of AIDS on African-American communities.

One such location was Ebbets Field in the heart of Brooklyn, where, through World War I, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, World War II, and the postwar struggles for equality in America, hardworking people enjoyed baseball. That small, unpredictable, and intimate ballpark was a gallery for characters to strut their stuff, and the characters in the stands took as much advantage of the opportunity as did the characters on the field. It was there that Jackie Robinson broke the color bar in Major League Baseball, and there that "Shorty's Sym-Phony Band" tortured the opposition. Words like "raucous" and "zany" are invoked to help those of us who were never present imagine the intensity and the uniqueness of what went on.<br><br>In 1957, Walter O'Malley, the owner of the Dodgers, moved them to Los Angeles. The horror of that act is undiminished in the voices of fans. "I felt like a jilted lover," recalls a sixty-year-old physician of the catastrophe that darkened his young life. Forty-six years after the Dodgers played their last game there, it remains important to people to tell the story of Ebbets Field, and in particular, to try to take us into its magic. This is the real essence of "nostalgia," an emotion that is in one second bitter, and in another sweet, as the rememberer vacillates between the joy of what was and the grief of the loss. Enduring sorrow and untempered anger are hallmarks of the stories related by fans of the Brooklyn Dodgers. "I never rooted for them again," says my doctor friend, and he is not alone in the implacable anger that still seems the only reasonable response to that kind of pain.<br><br>Three years after the Dodgers left, Ebbets Field was destroyed, and apartment buildings were erected on the site. People have to get the address and specific directions to find the small plaque that is all that remains of the cathedral of baseball which once stood there. And so the team is gone, the fans dispersed, the stadium demolished. Of deeper importance for people who had lots of work and not much hope, a place of magic was ripped from their daily lives, leaving them dull and gray. The loss of Ebbets Field was a tragedy that could not be repaired: it changed Brooklyn forever.<br><br>But how could the loss of a baseball stadium undermine what would be the fourth-largest city of the United States (were Brooklyn independent of the rest of New York City)?<br><br>The answer to this conundrum lies in understanding that places-buildings, neighborhoods, cities, nations-are not simply bricks and mortar that provide us shelter. Because we dance in a ballroom, have a parade in a street, make love in a bedroom, and prepare a feast in a kitchen, each of these places becomes imbued with sounds, smells, noises, and feelings of those moments and how we lived them. When we enter an old classroom, the smell of chalk on the boards can bring back a swarm of memories of classmates and lessons, boredom and dreams. Walking toward a favorite bar awakens expectations of friends and drinks, good times, good food. The breeze on a certain hillside reminds us of a class trip, while the sun in the garden brings thoughts of Dad. Try to find the shortcut you used to take to your best friend's house and it is your feet that will carry you there. The cues from place dive under conscious thought and awaken our sinews and bones, where days of our lives have been recorded.<br><br>Buildings and neighborhoods and nations are insinuated into us by life; we are not, as we like to think, independent of them. We are more like Siamese twins, conjoined to the locations of our daily life, such that our emotions flow through places, just as blood flows through two interdependent people. We can, indeed, separate from our places, but it is an operation that is best done with care. When a part is ripped away, as happened in Brooklyn when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, root shock ensues.<br><br>What Is Root Shock?<br><br>Root shock is the traumatic stress reaction to the destruction of all or part of one's emotional ecosystem. It has important parallels to the physiological shock experienced by a person who, as a result of injury, suddenly loses massive amounts of fluids. Such a blow threatens the whole body's ability to function. The nervous system attempts to compensate for the imbalance by cutting off circulation to the arms and legs. Suddenly the hands and feet will seem cold and damp, the face pale, and the brow sweaty. This is an emergency state that can<br><br>preserve the brain, the heart, and the other essential organs for only a brief period of time. If the fluids are not restored, the person will die. Shock is the fight for survival after a life-threatening blow to the body's internal balance.<br><br>Just as the body has a system to maintain its internal balance, so, too, the individual has a way to maintain the external balance between himself and the world. This way of moving in the environment maximizes the odds that he will survive predators, find food, maintain shelter from the harsh elements, and live in harmony with family and neighbors. This method for navigating the external environment is selected because, based on individual and collective trial-and-error experiences with the mazelike possibilities offered by the surrounding world, it seems to offer the greatest chances for survival. Using this analogy to mazes we can call the chosen pattern of movement "a way to run the maze of life," or, more simply, a "mazeway."<br><br>When the mazeway, the external system of protection, is damaged, the person will go into root shock. Just as a burn victim requires immediate replacement of fluids, so, too, the victim of root shock requires the support and direction of emergency workers who can erect shelter, provide food, and ensure safety until the victim has stabilized and can begin to take over these functions again.<br><br>Imagine the victim of an earthquake, a hurricane, a flood, or a terrorist attack. He suffers from root shock as he looks at the twisted remains of the known universe, searching for the road to the supermarket, which used to be there, but is now a pile of rubble. Imagining such a person-and knowing that these tragedies can happen to any of us-we open our hearts and wallets to the Red Cross and other relief organizations that show up immediately to be the temporary mazeway, the transfusion of an environment to those who are naked to the elements.<br><br>The experience of root shock-like the aftermath of a severe burn-does not end with emergency treatment, but will stay with the individual for a lifetime. In fact, the injury from root shock may be even more enduring than a burn, as it can affect generations and generations of people. Noah's ark-and his effort to rebuild the world after the flood-is the true story of a lost world. We keep telling that story because we keep living it, not simply when the floods come, but after they have receded and we try to rebuild.<br><br>Carlos Peterson, a resident of the Lower Hill, was deeply affected by the bulldozing of his neighborhood. He related, "I remember being able to look from the third floor and actually see the bulldozers and the destruction of where we once lived. This urban renewal process was preparation for Pittsburgh's Civic Arena. I was young and did not fully understand what was happening. I only knew this process was coming towards us. Coupled with the sense of personal loss of friends and neighborhood, this event had quite an influence on my life." As an adult, he gained a deeper understanding of the process that continued to destroy the neighborhood. It was with a sense of increasing urgency that he sought to document what was happening around him. The photograph shown here depicts the bulldozing in the area of Crawford Street, with the dome of the Civic Arena in the background, and exposed tree roots in the foreground. The disrupted context, exterior to the individual and the group, is the fundamental process that engenders root shock.<br><br>Carlos Peterson worked, as well, to depict the emotional impact the environmental devastation had on him. "I decided to express my feeling using drawings and photography. . . . I decided to look at my surroundings from a grassroots level, with the perspective of knowing how such conditions made me feel. My impression was that we were like a bunch of nomads always fleeing, that was the feeling I had.<br><br>"When creating my drawings I attempted to look at a building from within, and the structure's exterior. I would go into a vacant structure and photograph how it was, allowing memories of my experience to influence art. I would seek to tie in my impressions of what it would feel like had I been the last resident. Therefore, I would end up with a lot of stretched and distorted images that I thought reflected the economics in a downtrodden neighborhood."<br><br>In "Stream of Consciousness," the drawing shown here, the isolated buildings, open grave, and looming cross create a landscape of loss. The artist has placed his profile among the doomed buildings on the horizon. A dressmaker's model and a fallen stop sign are poignant reminders that this world once worked and moved and meant something to the people who lived in it. Thus, Carlos Peterson attempts to reveal the texture and content of the painful emotions that accompany root shock.<br><br>"This drawing contains symbolism that characterized my state of mind during the time when the Hill District was at its lowest ebb. My drawings were my therapy through the smothering depression that came with the area's carcass-like landscape. During that time I saw contradiction between religion and nature. Man-made structures and man always succumb to nature no matter how strong man's faith, prayer, or objects. . . . Nature renews itself through death and dying. With this realization, I included my profile near the horizon just beyond the fence, upper right."<br><br>Root shock, at the level of the individual, is a profound emotional upheaval that destroys the working model of the world that had existed in the individual's head. Root shock undermines trust, increases anxiety about letting loved ones out of one's sight, destabilizes relationships, destroys social, emotional, and financial resources, and increases the risk for every kind of stress-related disease, from depression to heart attack. Root shock leaves people chronically cranky, barking a distinctive croaky complaint that their world was abruptly taken away.<br><br>Root shock, at the level of the local community, be it neighborhood or something else, ruptures bonds, dispersing people to all the directions of the compass. Even if they manage to regroup, they are not sure what to do with one another. People who were near are too far, and people who were far are too near. The elegance of the neighborhood-each person in his social and geographic slot-is destroyed, and even if the neighborhood is rebuilt exactly as it was, it won't work. The restored geography is not enough to repair the many injuries to the mazeway.<br><br>Root shock, it is important to recognize, ripples out beyond those who are affected-in the way we like to measure these things. September 11 demonstrated our society's great love for distinguishing an "affected" group that needs help from an "unaffected" group that doesn't. While the "affected" people did need help, many more people were affected than was generally conceded. I was part of a call-in television show that aired just before the first anniversary of the attack. People from Queens or Staten Island called to say, "I feel bad, but nothing happened to me. It's making me feel guilty." I insisted, over and over again, that September 11 had happened to all of us and that the bad feeling was a natural reaction to having one's city attacked by terrorists.<br><br>But root shock goes even further than one city, linking a local tragedy to events around the globe. During the 1950s and '60s, a federal program called "urban renewal" destroyed hundreds of African American neighborhoods, many of which were home to jazz, a music that flowed through the communities from home to street to club. The young kids learning to play would linger outside the clubs to hear the music, dreaming of the day they might participate. Major chunks of the jazz world-the Fillmore in San Francisco, the Hill District in Pittsburgh, and the South Side of Chicago, among them-were torn up by urban renewal, and the structure of home-street-club was destroyed. Jazz nearly disappeared in the United States, surviving by dint of becoming an academic subject in high schools and colleges, played in a few austere clubs in New York and other big cities. The fact that the music endured had much to do with Europe and Japan, which offered performance sites where musicians might hone their craft and earn a living. Japan is now the top consumer of jazz CDs and Tokyo a "must stop" on a jazz ensemble's touring schedule.<br><br>Tobias von Sh�enebeck, a tour guide in Berlin, applied this principle of ripple effects on August 3, 2003, while watching fellow citizens participate in a new fad called "flash mob," which had apparently originated in New York two months earlier. At the Berlin event, the flash mob, called together by email and cell phone, gathered in front of the American embassy to pop bottles of champagne, toast Natasha, and disperse. Von Sh�enebeck shook his head, and muttered, "This is just the sort of thing that happens when you forbid New York to smoke." He was referring to the implementation in April 2003 of tough new laws outlawing smoking in New York City bars and restaurants. While few might have made the connection between New York's smoking laws and the fads that catch on in Berlin, it is exactly the kind of idea to which I am referring.<br><br>This lesson of interconnectedness is as hard to learn as differential calculus or quantum mechanics. The principle is simple: we-that is to say, all people-live in an emotional ecosystem that attaches us to the environment, not just as our individual selves, but as beings caught in a single, universal net of consciousness anchored in small niches we call neighborhoods or hamlets or villages. Because of the interconnectedness of the net, if your place is destroyed today, I will feel it hereafter.<br><br>Though a simple principle, it is hard to learn because the effects of root shock immediately get caught up in everything else that's going on in the world. As the message moves around the world, it is possible to think of many other explanations for an initial cause. Imagine how many factors, other than New York City's smoking laws, helped create the Berlin flash mob. The idea that your hurt has an effect on my life requires us to believe in "action at a distance," which makes the average scientist go rigid with skepticism.</p><h2>Graphic Guide to Interior Details: For Builders and Designers (For Pros By Pros)</h2><p><p>When Rob Thallon's Graphic Guide to Frame Construction was first published, it quickly became the indispensable guide to framing a house.

In this lively yet respectful pastiche, the Phantom created by Gaston Leroux comes up against Arthur Conan Doyle's remarkable detective, who has been engaged by the managers of the Paris Opera to thwart the Phantom's blackmail scheme. Siciliano (Blood Feud, Windsor, 1993) has invented several memorable supporting characters, including a beautiful but nearly blind pianist and a Watson substitute whose patience with Holmes's eccentricities is only slightly greater than that of the good doctor. The story itself takes the elements of Leroux's romantic novel and preserves characters, plot, and setting, making the most of the many cellars and mysterious passages under the Opera itself. The tone is Holmesian to the last detail, with the reader swept along to a satisfying ending. A fine addition to the Holmes canon, a summertime winner, and, one hopes, the start of a series. [In Nicholas Meyer's The Canary Trainer, Prepub Alert, LJ 5/15/93, Holmes also encounters the Phantom of the Opera.-Ed.]-Elsa Pendleton, Boeing Computer Support Svcs., Ridgecrest, Cal.<br><i>--Elsa Pendleton, Boeing Computer Support Svcs., Ridgecrest, Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1890 Sherlock Holmes and his cousin Dr. Henry Vernier are summoned to France to rid the great Paris Opera House of an "opera ghost." Readers familiar with Gaston Leroux's story will be on safe ground in Siciliano's retelling. An elusive phantom threatens the management of the Opera with unnamed disasters unless he's paid "several thousand francs a month" and young and beautiful Christine Daae is cast as the lead in their productions. Under the tutelage of the "Angel of Music," a fearfully disfigured musician living in the cellars of the Opera house, Christine becomes the rage of the Paris Opera. Holmes is hired by both the theater's management and the pompous and immature Viscount de Chagny, who adores Christine, to remove the Phantom's threat to profits and love. Although Holmes does little but interact with the other characters, through him and Vernier, the author re-examines the relationship of goodness and beauty. Siciliano's tale, while not original, is wonderfully atmospheric and moves briskly. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Living Like Ed: A Guide to the Eco-Friendly Life</h2><p>FROM THE PIONEER OF ECO-CONSCIOUS LIVING<br><br>A committed environmentalist for more than thirty years, Ed Begley, Jr., has always tried to &#x201c;live simply so others may simply live.&#x201d; Now, as more and more of us are looking for ways to reduce our impact on the planet and live a better, greener life, Ed shares his experiences on what works, what doesn't&#x2013;and what will save you money!<br><br>These are tips for environmentally friendly living that anyone&#x2013;whether you own or rent, live in a private home or a condo&#x2013;can try to make a positive change for the environment.

Visit him at LivingLikeEd.net.HOME TAKING AN OLD HOME&nbsp; AND MAKING IT GREEN I bought our house in 1988, a simple little two-bedroom house on a small lot in Studio City, California. Given my financial position at the time, it was a great move that has also turned out to be great for my career&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never felt pressured to take a role I didn&#x2019;t love just so I could make a huge mortgage payment. Of course, by Hollywood standards, this house is a shack. But by world standards, as I&#x2019;m sure you know, it is a palace. Retrofitting an Old House vs. Building New Few of us have the resources to build a more energy-efficient house from the ground up. I didn&#x2019;t have the money to do that, and I didn&#x2019;t have the will to do that. Plus I liked my house. So, I set out to make my home as environmentally sound as I could in every aspect. I knew that with insulation, a drought-tolerant garden, double-pane windows, an energy-saving thermostat, and solar panels I eventually put on the roof, I could make this a much more efficient structure. Indeed, by the time I was done, I had made my home nearly as energy efficient as a new one. And you can do the same for your home, wherever you live. The key to saving energy in your home is controlling energy use. Clearly, there are many ways to do this, from simple changes in what you do and how you do it to more-intense home improvement projects. Because so much of the energy used in your home is used to keep it warm in the winter and cool in the summer, we&#x2019;ll start with ways you can control your heating and cooling needs. And there&#x2019;s another important point I want to mention right up front: You don&#x2019;t have to own your home to make many of these changes. There&#x2019;s a lot you can do even if you&#x2019;re renting, or if you own a condominium or another type of structure where you might be limited as to the kinds of changes you can make. So why bother making these changes? Because they&#x2019;ll make your home more energy efficient, which means you&#x2019;ll be helping the environment by saving natural resources. It also means you&#x2019;ll be helping yourself and saving money&#x2014;sometimes really big money. So no matter where you live right now, you can make some changes that will make a real difference. A Fresh Filter Perhaps the easiest thing you can do today is change the air filter for your heating and air-conditioning system. Many people think, &#x201c;Filter? There&#x2019;s a filter?&#x201d; If that&#x2019;s you, yours probably hasn&#x2019;t been changed in a while. Most central heating and air-conditioning systems have a filter at the air intake&#x2014;on a wall or on the ceiling&#x2014;and many window and wall-unit air conditioners have a filter element on the front that needs to be changed, too. I change mine regularly, sometimes six times a year, because we have two cats and a dog, and pet hair is always blowing around. I check the air inlet for my heating and air-conditioning system regularly and often realize, &#x201c;Whoa! It&#x2019;s time to change this thing again.&#x201d; Why is changing the filter so important? Because when the filter gets dusty or dirty or clogged, it&#x2019;s harder for your system to pull air through it. That means your system has to work harder, and it has to stay on longer in order to do the same amount of work. So changing that filter regularly is the low-hanging fruit that you can&nbsp; pick right away. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you have central heat and air or a window- or wall-mount air conditioner. Changing the filter is a great way to make your home more energy efficient. Beyond that, changing the filter will help if anyone in your family suffers from allergies. You can even go a step further and choose an air filter that&#x2019;s designed especially to trap allergens. If odors are a problem in your home, there are filters designed to trap them, too. An Energy-Saving Thermostat Once you&#x2019;ve got the air moving more efficiently through your heating and cooling system, think about how you regulate the temperature of that air. It requires a huge amount of energy&#x2014;energy that you pay for in the form of your electric, oil, or gas bills&#x2014;to raise or lower the heat of your home by even a few degrees. Controlling these costs, and the amount of energy you use, means controlling the temperature both when you&#x2019;re at home and when you&#x2019;re away. This is the magic of an energy-saving thermostat. Most people simply turn their heating and air-conditioning system on and off when they want to be warmer or colder. Some even leave the system on when they leave the house, so that it will be the right temperature when they return. Maybe you leave the heat running at your preferred temperature all night long&#x2014;even though you&#x2019;re sleeping under a blanket or a comforter&#x2014;because you want the house to be nice and warm when you get up in the morning. But why spend all that money, and waste all that energy, keeping your house comfortable when you&#x2019;re not there, or when you can simply add another blanket to your bed at night? If you have central heating or central air-conditioning or both, you can install and use a programmable thermostat instead of an old &#x201c;set the temperature and it&#x2019;s either on or off&#x201d; thermostat. This way, you can save energy and money and have your house at the right temperature when you get home, when you wake up in the morning, and when you&#x2019;re asleep. You will have to invest some money up front; an energy-saving thermostat starts at about $65. But it will pay for itself in heating and cooling savings in a year or less if you use all of its features. Programming Your New Thermostat �Make sure you program the energy-saving thermostat to shut down the heat or air-conditioning automatically when you leave for work or for school, and to turn it back on 20 to 30 minutes before you expect to return. �You&#x2019;ll also want to program the thermostat to reduce the temperature when you&#x2019;re heating the house (or to increase the temperature when you&#x2019;re cooling it) about 30 to 60 minutes after you normally turn in for the night. Once you&#x2019;re under the covers and asleep, you won&#x2019;t require&nbsp; as much heating or even cooling. (You&#x2019;d be surprised how much less cooling is necessary to keep you comfortable at night. And you can always open a window in the summer if it&#x2019;s cooler outside at night.) Again, you just program the thermostat to return to &#x201c;awake&#x201d; mode 20&nbsp; to 30 minutes before your alarm goes off in the morning. �You don&#x2019;t need to worry about being uncomfortable if you&#x2019;re home all day on the weekend, either. Energy-saving thermostats let you program different settings for weekdays and weekends. �If you plan on going out of town, make sure you override your normal programming and shut down everything until you return. The caveat here is that if you&#x2019;re in a very cold climate and you&#x2019;re worried about your pipes freezing, don&#x2019;t let the temp fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. And you might not want to shut the system down completely if you&#x2019;re leaving pets in your home. Even so, you can see there&#x2019;s tremendous potential for energy savings here. Temperatures change day to day, so don&#x2019;t be afraid to adjust your program settings, daily if need be, to maximize the efficiency of your system. I check mine every time I leave the house. Choosing a Comfortable Temperature It&#x2019;s one thing to talk about programming the thermostat. Everybody says, &#x201c;Sure, makes sense.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s another thing entirely to try to reach an agreement with the people living in your home about what temperature is comfortable. Let me talk about the temperature in my house before Rachelle and after Rachelle. When I was single, I would keep the house at 65 to 68 degrees in the winter and 78 in the summer. I didn&#x2019;t think twice about simply wearing a sweater or sweatshirt in the winter and changing into a cotton T-shirt and shorts in the summer. There is no amount of thermostat programming that can replace good ol&#x2019; shutting down the heating and cooling completely when the temperatures outside and inside your home are within your own personal comfort zone. Well, that ain&#x2019;t gonna fly anymore in my home. I have a wife and a daughter who require considerably more creature comfort than I did when living on my own. If you have a really old heating and air-conditioning unit, you might want to consider purchasing a new Energy Star system. It&#x2019;s going to be a big investment, but you&#x2019;re going to make that money back in a few years because the units are so much more efficient now, and use so much less power. The compressors are more efficient, the fans are more efficient, everything about the system&#x2019;s more efficient. You can literally save up to 20 percent on your yearly heating and cooling costs with a new, more energy-efficient unit. What Energy Star Means Many people think Energy Star is a brand name or a particular company. Actually, it&#x2019;s a program created jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. Its goal is laudable: to help everybody save money and protect the environment through energy-efficient products and practices. And the program is working. To benefit from this program, you just look for the Energy Star symbol on a product. It&#x2019;s like a seal of approval. To wear it, that product has to meet strict energy efficiency guidelines. You can find the Energy Star symbol on all kinds of things, from complete homes to appliances and office equipment, including �central air-conditioning units and room air conditioners �ceiling fans (another great way to reduce cooling costs and energy use) �furnaces �dehumidifiers �refrigerators and freezers �clothes washers �dishwashers �windows and skylights �doors �roofing products �insulation �televisions, VCRs, and DVD players �computers and monitors �fax machines, printers, and scanners �cordless phones �ligh...</p><h2>Inside the Third Reich</h2><p>The author was a personal friend of Adolf Hitler for 12 years until he turned against him. This is an inside account of The Third Reich and the man who invented it.</p><p>From 1946 to 1966, while serving the prison sentence handed down from the Nuremburg War Crimes tribunal, Albert Speer penned 1,200 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. Titled <i>Erinnerungen</i> ("Recollections") upon their 1969 publication in German, Speer's critically acclaimed personal history was translated into English and published one year later as <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>. Long after their initial publication, Speer's memoir continues to provide one of the most detailed and fascinating portrayals of life within Hitler's inner circles, the rise and fall of the third German empire, and of Hitler himself.<p> Speer chronicles his entire life, but the majority of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> focuses on the years between 1933 and 1945, when Speer figured prominently in Hitler's government and the German war effort as Inspector General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Federal Capital and later as Minister of Arms and Munitions. Speer's recollections of both duties foreground the impossibility of reconciling Hitler's idealistic, imperialistic ambitions with both architectural and military reality. Throughout, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> remains true to its author's intentions. With compelling insight, Speer reveals many of the "premises which almost inevitably led to the disasters" of the Third Reich as well as "what comes from one man's holding unrestricted power in his hands." <i>-- Bertina Loeffler</i></p>Albert Speer was unique in the Third Reich. An intellectual architect, he was befriended by Hitler in 1933 and for the next 12 years they maintained one of the most powerful and extraordinary relationships in the Nazi hierarchy. In 1942 Speer was appointed Armaments Minister and became second only to Hitler himself as a power on the home front. But in 1945, Speer defied Hitler&#x2019;s scorched earth policy and began to plan his assassination.

This is her number. It's on the site." Pierce has just moved into a new apartment, and he's been "chasing the dime"--doing all it takes so his company comes out first with a scientific breakthrough worth millions. But he can't get the messages for Lilly out of his head. As Pierce tries to help a woman he has never met, he steps into a world of escorts, websites, sex, and secret passions. A world where his success and expertise mean nothing...and where he becomes the chief suspect in a murder case, trapped in the fight of his life.</strong></p><p>Henry Pierce is about to become very rich--as soon as his firm, Amedeo Technologies, gets an infusion of capital from a big backer. But the brilliant chemist's workaholic habits are disrupted when his lover, the former intelligence officer of his company, breaks up with him. Lonely and dispirited, he moves into a new apartment and gets a new phone number that attracts a lot of callers, but not for him. His new telephone number seems to have previously belonged to one Lilly Quinlan, an escort whose Internet photo arouses Henry's curiosity, especially when L.A. Darlings, whose Web page features the beautiful young woman, can't tell Henry how to find her. With the same single-mindedness that made him a high-tech superstar, Pierce pursues his search for the missing girl, motivated by his guilt over the disappearance years earlier of his own sister, who, like Lilly, was also a prostitute (and ultimately the victim of the Dollmaker, a serial killer from Connelly's 1994 novel <i>The Concrete Blonde</i>.) But that motive is too thin to support Pierce's sudden abandonment of his career at such a critical juncture, even if forces unknown to him are setting him up for a fall. Despite those holes in the plot and a less than compelling protagonist, the novel succeeds due to Connelly's literary and expository gifts and his more interesting secondary characters. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Michael Connelly (born July 21, 1956, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American author of detective novels, notably those featuring Detective Hieronymus &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch. Bosch, named after the Dutch painter of the same name, is the protagonist of a series of Connelly&#39;s novels. The character is an LAPD detective. The Black Echo, the first book featuring Bosch, won the Mystery Writers of America&#39;s Edgar Award for Best First Novel of 1992. Connelly has written other books outside the Bosch series, including Blood Work, which was made into a 2002 movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In 2006, The Lincoln Lawyer was selected as one of ten books to feature in Richard and Judy&#39;s televised book club.

The similarities are striking. In both cases innovations have been presented as the long awaited solution to an old problem: the advent of powerful synthetic insecticides has, overnight, dramatically reduced the costs and increased agricultural productivity; the advent of the modern safe technique of caesarean section has offered serious new reasons to create gigantic obstetrical departments. In both spheres a small number of skeptics voiced doubts and fears concerning the negative long-term consequences of the widespread use of novel, little tested practices; although these repeated warnings initially went unheeded, they have motivated the development of &#34;alternative&#34; approaches and movements. At the turn of the new century the history of industrialized farming has suddenly speeded up. A collective global awareness has been sparked by a series of disasters, particularly &#34;mad cow&#34; and foot and mouth diseases. Industralized childbirth has not yet reached the same phase of its history, but the parallels between these two industries suggest that there is more to link the farmer and the obstetrician than we had all realized..</p><p>For several decades Michel Odent has played multiple and complimentary roles in influencing the history of childbirth and health research. Familiarly known as the obstetrician who introduced the concepts of birthing pools and home-like birthing rooms. He is the uthor of more than 50 scientific papers and 10 books including &#34;Scientification of Love&#34;</p><h2>Zen Is Right Here: Teaching Stories and Anecdotes of Shunryu Suzuki, Author of &#34;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&#34;</h2><p>Shunryu Suzuki&#x2019;s extraordinary gift for conveying traditional Zen teachings using ordinary language is well known to the countless readers of <i>Zen Mind, Beginner&#x2019;s Mind</i>. In <i>Zen Is Right Here</i>, his teachings are brought to life powerfully and directly through stories told about him by his students. These living encounters with Zen are poignant, direct, humorous, paradoxical, and enlightening; and their setting in real-life contexts makes them wonderfully accessible. <br><br>Like the Buddha himself, Suzuki Roshi gave profound teachings that were skilfully expressed for each moment, person, and situation he encountered. He emphasized that while the ungraspable essence of Buddhism is constant, the expression of that essence is always changing. Each of the stories presented here is an example of this versatile and timeless quality, showing that the potential for attaining enlightenment exists right here, right now, in this very moment.</p><p>Shunryu Suzuki (1904&#x2013;1971) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century and is truly a founding father of Zen in America. A Japanese priest of the Soto lineage, he taught in the United States from 1959 until his death. He was the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center and the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. He is the author of <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i> and <i>Branching Streams Flow in the Darkness: Zen Talks on the Sandokai</i>, and he is the subject of the biography <i>Crooked Cucumber </i> by David Chadwick."These brief personal stories, which are contributed anonymously, offer a strong sense of Suzuki Roshi, his teachings, and his enduring sense of humor."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br>"Like a temple bell that strikes through the air to the heart of sound, these anecdotes and quotes offer humor, wisdom, enlightenment, brio, and a perfect example of a Zen life lived every day&#x2014;that of Soto Zen priest Shunryu Suzuki who helped introduce thousands of Americans to Zen. . . .

A Dominican, dining with the Gills, once thought he saw a nimbus shining around Eric&#39;s head. Despite the sexual improprieties it unearths, MacCarthy&#39;s authoritative biography allows you to understand how someone might have thought that.&#39; John Carey, Sunday Times</p><p>A well-known broadcaster and critic, Fiona MacCarthy established herself as one of the leading writers of biography in Britain with her widely acclaimed book Eric Gill, published in 1989. Her biography of Byron was described by A. N. Wilson as &#39;a flawless triumph&#39; and William Morris won the Wolfson History Prize and the Writers&#39; Guild Non-Fiction Award. She most recently published Last Curtsey, a memoir of her early life as a debutante. Fiona is a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an Hon. Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She was awarded the OBE for services to literature in 2009.An English artist-craftsman in the tradition of William Morris, Eric Gill (1882-1940) exemplifies the search for a lifestyle to heal the split between work and leisure, art and industry. He is remembered today for his fine engravings and stone carvings, his legendary typefaces and book designs for the Golden Cockerel Press. Yet there was another side to the man, downplayed by previous biographers: a fervent convert to Catholicism and leader of three Catholic arts-and-crafts communes, Gill had a hyperactive libido which extended to incest with his sisters and daughters, as well as numerous extramarital affairs, according to British writer MacCarthy. He rationalized his penile acrobatics by inventing a bizarre pseudoreligious theory. In MacCarthy's candid portrait, Gill, who preserved the outward image of a devout father-figure, was neither saint nor humbug, but a highly sexed creative artist trapped by his Victorian concept of masculinity. This charismatic firebrand was a renegade Fabian socialist, a bohemian friend of Augustus John and Bertrand Russell. His adventurous life, as re-created in this beautifully written, absorbing biography, is disturbingly relevant to our time.

Trudy had dutifully strapped herself into her seat and lowered it back to the full reclining position, as instructed in the safety lecture that played on the screen set into the passenger compartment&#x2019;s overhead paneling. <br>Then the rocket engines had lit off and the ship hurtled off its launchpad with a deafening roar and bone-rattling vibration. The launch from Earth had been much gentler, and she assumed that a liftoff in the Moon&#x2019;s light gravity would be just as easy. <br>Something&#x2019;s gone wrong! Trudy thought. The g-force pushed her down into the reclined seat like a ton of cement on her chest. And it wouldn&#x2019;t stop. She thought of the earthquake she&#x2019;d experienced in Palo Alto, when she&#x2019;d been a grad student. It went on and on, the whole world shaking and grinding, the dorm building swaying like a ship in a typhoon. Afterward, she was told that the tremor had lasted seventy-eight seconds. But it sure felt like hours. <br>The rocket engines stopped abruptly, leaving Trudy&#x2019;s ears ringing and her arms floating off the seat&#x2019;s armrests. Her stomach crawled up into her throat. She swallowed bile and swore to herself that she would <i>not</i> upchuck. <br>The pilot&#x2019;s grinning face appeared on the overhead screen. &#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re well and truly launched. We&#x2019;ll be at Farside in thirty-two minutes.&#x201d; Almost as an afterthought he added, &#x201c;You can crank your seats up now and enjoy the view.&#x201d; <br>Carefully Trudy raised her seat. She swallowed again and told herself that she&#x2019;d experienced zero gravity on the flight up from Earth and there was absolutely no reason why she should get sick from it now. <br>Besides, there was this awesome hunk of a guy in the seat across the aisle from her and she&#x2019;d be damned to hell and back if she was going to make an ass of herself in front of him. <br>He was smiling at her. &#x201c;Quite a takeoff, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>Trudy nodded weakly. <br>&#x201c;These ballistic flights,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;they slam on all the power at liftoff and then let the bird coast the rest of the way. No atmosphere to worry about, we just fly along an arc like an old-time artillery shell.&#x201d; <br>He&#x2019;s an Adonis! Trudy thought. Handsome, chiseled features; sparkling light brown eyes; thick dark hair long enough to tickle the collar of his expensive-looking jacket. Good broad shoulders, flat midsection. The kind who never looks at mousy little me, she told herself. And here I&#x2019;m wearing this drab old pullover and jeans. Should have dressed better, should have thought of looks instead of comfort. <br>It took an effort for her to find her voice. &#x201c;The ship looks like the Clipperships they use on Earth. Only kind of smaller.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Most of the Clippers back Earthside are manufactured here on the Moon. At Selene. They use nanomachines to build &#x2019;em out of carbon dust. Soot gets turned into diamond structure, thanks to nanotechnology.&#x201d; <br>Trudy knew that. Everybody knew that, but this hunk of a stud was talking to her as if he were a professor and she a freshman. <br>&#x201c;I thought the liftoff would be easier,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Gentler. What with the Moon&#x2019;s lower gravity&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;No, they blast off at four gees. Then coast. Here on the Moon they call these ships &#x2018;lobbers.&#x2019; They just lob them up and out, like artillery shells.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, you told me that.&#x201d; <br>He smiled at her, teeth dazzling bright. &#x201c;So I did.&#x201d; Then he extended a hand across the narrow aisle. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Carter McClintock.&#x201d; <br>His hand engulfed hers. &#x201c;Trudy Yost.&#x201d; <br>He cocked his head. &#x201c;Trudy? Is that short for Gertrude?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Trudy snapped. &#x201c;Everybody thinks that. My parents named me Trudy. It&#x2019;s on my birth certificate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay. Okay.&#x201d; He released her hand, then asked, &#x201c;So what brings you to Farside?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be doing my postdoc work there. Under Professor Uhlrich.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re the astronomer,&#x201d; said McClintock, looking impressed. &#x201c;The professor&#x2019;s new assistant.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be working with him on the optical interferometer. We&#x2019;re going to image Sirius C.&#x201d; <br>He nodded uncertainly. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Earth-sized planet that was discovered about ten years ago,&#x201d; Trudy explained. <br>&#x201c;The one they call New Earth, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Right. It&#x2019;s about two and a half parsecs from us, and it&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Parsecs?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Three point two six light-years. It&#x2019;s the distance an object would be if it showed a parallax of one arc second. Parallax. Second. Parsec.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh. Yes. I see.&#x201d; He leaned his chair back slightly and turned his attention to the overhead screen. <br>Stupid, stupid, stupid! Trudy raged at herself. Here you&#x2019;ve got this hunk chatting with you and you bury him in jargon. Why do you have to show everybody how smart you are? It&#x2019;s stupid. You just drive them away. <br>For several moments she sat rigidly in her chair, staring at the display screen, which showed the lunar landscape sliding by far beneath them. <br>The lobber&#x2019;s passenger compartment was only half full. Six men and women heading for Farside. <br>Consciously refraining from biting her lip, Trudy turned back to McClintock and asked, &#x201c;And why are you going to Farside?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I work there, same as you&#x2019;re going to,&#x201d; he said, brightening slightly. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an astronomer?&#x201d; <br>He flashed that knockout smile again. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;&#x2026; uh, I&#x2019;m in management. I work with Professor Uhlrich, help him with administrative matters.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Trudy, glowing inside. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll see a lot of each other, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I imagine we will.&#x201d; <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ben Bova <br></p><h2>Skellig (Printz Honor)</h2><p><i>David Almond&#x2019;s Printz Honor&#x2013;winning novel is a captivating modern classic.<br><br></i>Ten-year-old Michael was looking forward to moving into a new house. But now his baby sister is ill, his parents are frantic, and Doctor Death has come to call. Michael feels helpless. Then he steps into the crumbling garage. . . . What is this thing beneath the spiderwebs and dead flies? A human being, or a strange kind of beast never before seen? The only person Michael can confide in is his new friend, Mina. Together they carry the creature out into the light, and Michael&#x2019;s world changes forever. . . .</p><p><i>"I thought he was dead. He was sitting with his legs stretched out and his head tipped back against the wall. He was covered with dust and webs like everything else and his face was thin and pale. Dead bluebottles were scattered on his hair and shoulders. I shined the flashlight on his white face and his black suit."</i><p> This is Michael's introduction to Skellig, the man-owl-angel who lies motionless behind the tea chests in the abandoned garage in back of the boy's dilapidated new house. As disturbing as this discovery is, it is the least of Michael's worries. The new house is a mess, his parents are distracted, and his brand-new baby sister is seriously ill. Still, he can't get this mysterious creature out of his mind--even as he wonders if he has really seen him at all. What unfolds is a powerful, cosmic, dreamlike tale reminiscent of Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>. British novelist David Almond works magic as he examines the large issues of death, life, friendship, love, and the breathtaking connections between all things.</p><p> Amidst the intensity and anxiety of his world, Michael is a normal kid. He goes to school, plays soccer, and has friends with nicknames like Leakey and Coot. It's at home where his life becomes extraordinary, with the help of Skellig and Mina, the quirky, strong-willed girl next door with "the kind of eyes you think can see right through you." Mina and her mother's motto is William Blake's "How can a bird that is born for joy / Sit in a cage and sing?" This question carries us through the book, as we see Michael's baby sister trapped in a hospital incubator; as we see the exquisite, winged Skellig crumpled in the garage; as we meet Mina's precious blackbird chicks and the tawny owls in her secret attic; and as we finally see a braver, bolder Michael spread his wings and fly. <i>Skellig</i> was the Whitbread Award's 1998 Children's Book of the Year, and this haunting novel is sure to resonate with readers young and old.

In 1904, her Norwegian-born mother, Carrine Gafkjen, age 25, set out alone from Minnesota and staked a 160-acre claim; in those early days she walked five miles to a creek to wash her clothes and fetch drinking water. At 34, when she married homesteader Sever Berg and he moved onto her property (which was larger than his own), she became a prairie housewife, turning out five meals a day and preparing Norwegian specialties such as lefse, a 24-inch potato pancake baked directly on top of a cast-iron range. Young and her siblings endured their own trials, notably their efforts to herd their mother's flock of turkeys--animals, she wryly notes, that are "congenitally indisposed to the principle of herding." Here too is celebration, like Syttende Mai (Norwegian Independence Day), a holiday ignored by the women, but which the men spent drinking and "swearing deathless allegiance" to the Old Country, "on which most of them had never laid eyes." Photos not seen by PW . <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- Readers are treated to history at its liveliest in these eight essays. Young tells of her pioneer mother's early westering experiences and those of herself and her five siblings. Like Laura Ingalls Wilder, she admits to the hardships of pioneering after the turn of the century but accentuates the positive aspects. She tells of her mother's 1904 trek to North Dakota to homestead alone and explains that the woman was a successful landowner of 320 acres when she married and began her family. This is a natural read-aloud for secondary history classes, and it offers excellent examples of personal essays for journalism and English classes. It's a terrific read for everybody.<br><i>- Barbara Hawkins, West Potomac High Sch . , Fairfax, VA</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mother</h2><p>This is a difficult age to be a woman. The woman who aspires to raise children for the glory of God, to develop the ministry of the home, or to co-labor with her husband is deemed "old-fashioned" or "unfulfilled." The modern lure of independence and career has bewitched an entire generation to exchange the beauty of Christian womanhood for the temporary enticements of a society at war with the family. Amidst this confusion, Kathleen Norris's <i>Mother</i> is a refreshing call to sanity. <i>Mother</i> is the fictional tale of a young lady who leaves home and repudiates family life in the hope of finding personal fulfillment through independence and a career. She decides that home life is a poor choice in the face of life in the big city. But God dramatically changes her heart, and she realizes that wealth and position are illusory and that independence can enslave a young lady. She discovers that the greatest woman she has ever known is her mother. Now she longs for home and for motherhood. After reading this book, one woman wrote, "As I turned the last page, tears filled my eyes. I knelt by my bed and asked God to forgive me for my bitterness and my unwillingness to trust and obey Him." Vision Forum is pleased to offer this restored and revised version of the 1911 classic in the hope that girls will once again aspire to be like their mothers.</p><p></p><h2>Blockbuster Plots: Pure &amp; Simple</h2><p>By effectively demonstrating the relationship between plot and scene and explaining the art of story design, Blockbuster Plots offers writers proven techniques for creating more focused and balanced plotlines.</p><p>An exciting new approach to understanding plot from writing expert, Martha Alderson, M.A., the unique Scene Tracker and Plot Planner system is guaranteed to help writers master this elusive craft. About the Book For most writers, the most difficult part of the writing process is the inability to see the forest for the trees. Blockbuster Plots dedicates itself to the structure of plot and has already helped hundreds of novelists, memoirists, and creative non-fiction writers master this elusive craft. Written by an educational expert and award-winning novelist, Blockbuster Plots offers writers a firm understanding of scene, and presents techniques that will help them develop a winning storyline. Introducing two innovative tools&#x2014;the Scene Tracker and Plot Planner&#x2014;the author shows writers how to create a visual representation of the layers of their story and consequently see what&#x2019;s missing, and anticipate their characters&#x2019; every move, so that the dramatic action doesn&#x2019;t peter off into the seductive wiles of detail. By effectively demonstrating the relationship between plot and scene and explaining the art of story design, Blockbuster Plots offers writers proven techniques for creating more focused and balanced plotlines.<p> Features Unique in the marketplace: no other fiction writing guide offers tools like the Scene Tracker and Plot Planner.</p>Plot is a series of scenes arranged by cause and effect to create dramatic action filled with tension, conflict and suspense to further the character emotional development and create thematic significance. <p>Are you confused about plot? You are not alone. It took me years to pin down plot. I longed for something more concrete, not a formula per se, but specific guidelines to help bring depth to my story lines. I searched for anything I could find that directly addressed the issue of plot development. Unable to find much, I berated myself for not grasping what everyone else seemed to understand. But the muse continued to haunt me. Over time, I came to realize that everyone else was struggling with plot; they just were not talking about it. </p><p>Through years of perseverance and determination, I pinned down the elusive concept of plot to the point where I could actually "see" it. Wanting to save others the frustration I had experienced and using what I know about how people learn, I started teaching plot to writers. BLOCKBUSTER PLOTS Pure &amp; Simple (BBP) came out of that passion. </p><p>The techniques I offer in BBP have helped hundreds of writers create dramatic action plots and heighten tension and suspense in scenes as well as in the overall project. In workshops and private plot consultations, I have witnessed what happens when writers delve more deeply into the dynamics of cause and effect. If you explore how well-constructed characters in conflict act as the driving force behind an exceptional story, you will be better able to create your own exceptional stories. Explore the themes of your own life, and your projects will have lasting meaning. </p><p>My intention in writing BBP is to help you understand plot quickly and effortlessly. Writing is challenging enough. I am passionate about eliminating for writers the frustration of something as basic as plot.</p></p><h2>The River of Consciousness</h2><p><b>A profoundly fascinating, illuminating major work from the beloved, bestselling thinker and neurologist Oliver Sacks--completed by him just before his death--provides readers with a compelling, rare gift from the master.</b><i><br><br>The River of Consciousness</i> reflects Oliver Sacks at his wisest and most humane, as he examines some of the human animal's most remarkable faculties: memory, creativity, consciousness, and our present, ongoing evolution. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before his death, Sacks personally collected into this one volume his recent essays and case studies, never before published in book form, which he felt best displayed his passionate engagement with his most compelling and seminal ideas. The book, lucid and accessible as ever, is a mirror of his own consciousness, discovering in his personal and humane interactions with others, unique insight, and fresh meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Featuring a preface written two weeks before his death, <i>The River of Consciousness</i> reveals the beloved, bestselling author's unique ability to make unexpected connections, his sheer joy in knowledge, and his unceasing, timeless project to understand what it is that makes us human.</p><p>OLIVER SACKS was born in 1933 in London and was educated at Queen's College, Oxford. He completed his medical training at San Francisco's Mount Zion Hospital and at UCLA before moving to New York.<br>Familiar to the readers of <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i> and <i>The</i> <i>New York Review of Books</i>, Dr. Sacks spent more than fifty years working as a neurologist and wrote many books, including <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Musicophilia</i> and <i>Hallucinations, </i>about the strange neurological predicaments and conditions of his patients. Over the years he received many awards, including honours from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Royal College of Physicians. His memoir, <i>On the Move,</i> was published shortly before his death in August 2015.&#x201c;Oliver Sacks&#x2019;s voice has not been totally silenced by his passing. We can now add <i>The River of Consciousness</i> to the impressive list of his writings on the quest to better understand the human mind and natural world in which we live. Even now, Dr. Sacks continues to enthrall.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i><br><br> &#x201c;[O]ne always feels with each new work from Sacks that a conversation is simply continuing, one never less than rigorously curious, but also necessarily circular, referencing previous points of engagement as a way to move forward or expand an ever-yielding idea.

These beautiful, lucid, often profound essays enlighten and unify seemingly disparate subjects: the relativity of our perception of time and speed, the nature of consciousness, Freud&#x2019;s discovery of the Unconscious, and its relation to creativity. And he explores our emerging insight, that wherever life exists on Darwin&#x2019;s evolutionary Tree of Life, even on its lower branches, there is probably sentience, something mental, such that the river of consciousness and the river of life flow into each other far more than we have understood.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Norman Doidge, MD</b>, author of <i>The Brain That Changes Itself</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oliver Sacks knew how much his readers would miss him.

These stories he tied around his reader&#x2019;s wrist, as with a child. His words led us, guiding us out of our incomprehension and into the light of reason. Forever a healer, Oliver Sacks compounded a medicine to salve our grief, even as he lay dying. Sacks lovingly outlined ten such stories before he left us, and indeed, blessed are we who mourn.&nbsp; I read these essays in one night, spellbound as he described petals, cameras, bombs&#x2014;and, of course, neurons&#x2014;so enraptured with details that only later did I realize how he had also explained the weightiness of time, memory and learning itself. <i>The River of Consciousness</i> is the precious voice of Oliver Sacks come back to us to do what all great seers do: lead us to places that we could never have found on our own.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Hope Jahren</b>, author of <i>Lab Girl</i></p><h2>The Moth Catcher (Vera Stanhope)</h2><p>Moth Catcher</p><p>ANN CLEEVES was the Malice Domestic Honored International Visitor in 2015.

Now Salander is fighting back.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> As the finale to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </i>is not content to merely match the adrenaline-charged pace that made international bestsellers out of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>. Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em>Stieg Larsson,<b> </b>who lived in Sweden, was the editor in chief of the magazine <i>Expo</i> and a leading expert on antidemocratic, right-wing extremist and Nazi organizations.

Their actions spared these magnificent pieces from the threat of destruction, first by the invading Soviets in 1979 and more recently by the Taliban. Exquisitely crafted in gold and ivory, the artifacts illustrate Afghanistan&#x2019;s key place at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, at the center of the ancient Silk Road a rich heritage to be displayed at four major U.S. museums through 2009.

Through entertainments and "educational" books that belittled African Americans, as well as the living examples of his own family, Dew was indoctrinated in a white supremacy that, at best, was condescendingly paternalistic and, at worst, brutally intolerant. The fear that southern culture, and the "hallowed white male brotherhood," could come undone through the slightest flexibility in the color line gave the Jim Crow mindset its distinctly unyielding quality. Dew recalls his father, in most regards a decent man, becoming livid over a black tradesman daring to use the front, and not the back, door.</p><p>The second half of the book shows how this former Confederate youth and descendant of Thomas Roderick Dew, one of slavery&#x2019;s most passionate apologists, went on to reject his racist upbringing and become a scholar of the South and its deeply conflicted history. The centerpiece of Dew&#x2019;s story is his sobering discovery of a price circular from 1860--an itemized list of humans up for sale. Contemplating this document becomes Dew&#x2019;s first step in an exploration of antebellum Richmond&#x2019;s slave trade that investigates the terrible--but, to its white participants, unremarkable--inhumanity inherent in the institution.</p><p>Dew&#x2019;s wish with this book is to show how the South of his childhood came into being, poisoning the minds even of honorable people, and to answer the question put to him by Illinois Browning Culver, the African American woman who devoted decades of her life to serving his family: "Charles, why do the grown-ups put so much hate in the children?"</p><p></p></p><p><p>Charles B.

His new book, which combines an honest autobiography of life in the 1950s with a sobering account of archival history and reckoning, is a characteristically eloquent reflection.

And yet most everyone has. Her newspaper articles and nationally syndicated columns fill hundreds of boxes in the archives of Kansas State University. Her book How America Eats was considered groundbreaking in 1960, but now it's largely unknown and out of print. But not long ago Paddleford was a formidable figure -- arguably the originator of popular food writing in this country. Before magazines racks were devoted to cooking, before newspapers had food sections, before celebrity TV chefs were even imagined, Clementine Paddleford was Julia Child, Rachael Ray, Margaret Mead and the Food Network rolled into one. Over a writing career that spanned nearly five decades, she sought out, sampled and wrote about American regional fare. She even piloted her own single-engine plane to sample pot roast in Pennsylvania, "kornette rolls" on the passenger train that ran from Missouri to Texas, frozen bananas in Hawaii and a "Senate Salad" of lobster, avocado and grapefruit in the U.S. Capitol. Every morsel of this ended up in her writings, along with a portrait of America before television, fast food and microwave convenience united us all. "Tell me where your grandmother came from and I can tell you how many kinds of pie you serve for Thanksgiving," she wrote in How America Eats. "In the Midwest two is the usual, mince and pumpkin. In the South no pie but wine jelly, tender and trembling, topped with whipped cream. Down East it's a threesome, cranberry, mince and pumpkin, a sliver of each, and sometimes, harking back to the old days around Boston, four kinds of pie were traditional for this feast occasion -- mince, cranberry, pumpkin and a kind called Marlborough, a glorification of everyday apple." To be sure, there are some -- mostly food writers and editors -- who remember who Paddleford was and what she accomplished, and these faithful have conferred on her something of a cult status and kept How America Eats among the most requested out-of-print books. One day last month the online bookseller Alibris listed 15 copies, including one signed by the author with "light edge wear . . . pieces missing and soil marks" for $480. Clementine Paddleford (Perhaps her mother was channeling Beatrix Potter? The name is a near twin of Jemima Puddle-Duck.) was born in 1898 in tiny Stockdale, Kan. In her teens, lacking any immediate role models, she fixed on the notion of becoming a journalist, writing gossipy squibs about local worthies for the Daily Chronicle of nearby Manhattan, Kan. She earned a degree in "industrial journalism" from Kansas State Architectural College then lit out for New York, enrolling in the Columbia School of Journalism and taking night classes at New York University. Young, alone and utterly undeterred, she found a room in a boarding house and started writing snippets and bits for the old New York Sun and New York Telegram. Over the next few years she wrote and networked her way into a job as woman's editor for Farm &amp; Fireside, a semi-monthly magazine featuring earnest advice for housewives about cleaning, cooking, beauty and nutrition for "better babies." Her big break came in 1936 when she was hired by the New York Herald-Tribune to be a food editor and writer in what was called the paper's "Home Institute." Four years later she added to her workload and her reputation by creating a weekly column on food for This Week magazine, a syndicated Sunday newspaper supplement. To all this, she eventually added a monthly "Food Flashes" column for Gourmet magazine. She would expand and redefine all these roles over the next 30 years, becoming well known, well paid and widely traveled. She approached her subject with enormous seriousness -- part journalist, part historian, but fundamentally an anthropologist, revealing how Americans lived by chronicling what they ate. In 1946 she covered Winston Churchill's visit to Fulton, Mo., scene of his famous Iron Curtain speech. (The great man was served country ham, fried chicken and twice-baked potatoes.) She covered the coronation feast for Queen Elizabeth in 1953 (a six-course meal that included turtle soup, roast Angus beef and a puff pastry dessert called Maids of Honor). She wangled recipes from famous restaurants (cheesecake from Lindy's delicatessen, Hollandaise sauce from Antoine's in the French Quarter, Caesar salad from the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center), which are reprinted in Hometown Appetites. (A note at the end of the book explains that all printed recipes were tested and some updated for contemporary tastes and ingredients.) Her writing style was a gush of enthusiasm and adjectives, with a tone of earnestness evoking a far less cynical era. Describing, for example, those kornette rolls served in a 1949 railroad dining car, Paddleford writes: "So tiny -- one, two, three are not too many of these dainty corn morsels. 'Kornette boy! This way, please!' Here's something that should be eaten in sets of a dozen." Paddleford's ascent brings home her single-minded ambition at a time when few women put career first. After she left Manhattan, Kan., for that other Manhattan, there was a marriage to an ardent Kansas swain, but Paddleford never stopped writing and traveling long enough to actually live with him, and eventually he gave up on her. By all accounts she was a rather indifferent cook. She took on the role of guardian for the adolescent daughter of a dying friend but had no children of her own. There were, over the years, loyal friends and apparently plenty of lovers (her otherwise exhaustive diaries are discreet on this point). There was also a grim diagnosis of throat cancer, when she was only 33. Remarkably, she survived, but thereafter had a silver tracheotomy tube in her neck, which she disguised with a dark ribbon tied to look like a choker. Honestly though, the black-and-white photos in the book reveal that her dress in general was so outlandish that you might not notice the ribbon. In her prime, Paddleford had 12 million readers. When she died in 1967, her obituary ran in all of the country's major newspapers. Her reputation has faded ever since, eclipsed now by legions of more sophisticated food writers and celebrity chefs. This biography, by Kelly Alexander, a food writer and editor at Saveur magazine, and Cynthia Harris, an archivist at Kansas State University, is an energetic attempt to rescue Paddleford from obscurity. The story they have unearthed proves as illuminating of the era as it does of the woman herself. It also whets the appetite to go back and read the real thing. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Set in Kyoto, the Japanese city most symbolic of tradition, the story centers on a young woman, Chieko, whohaving been brought up to think her parents stole her as a baby in a fit of passionate desireis profoundly disturbed to learn (after a chance encounter with a girl who turns out to be her sister) that her real parents had abandoned her. Her identity crisis is exacerbated by her need to choose between carrying on her adoptive father's kimono-designing business, now in decay, and leaving home to marry.

Among the 11 short stories, "The Stuff of Madness" tells of a woman who displays her dead stuffed pets in the garden, and of her husband's final revolt. "A Clock Ticks at Christmas" is about the breakup of the marriage between a woman born rich and a man who had to make his money, and their opposite reactions to a theft by two urchins she befriends. In "The Button," a man displaces his rage at his Mongoloid son by killing a stranger. In the title story, a government official injured in an assassination attempt on the President suffers a personality change he is unaware of, although everyone else notices his altered behavior. The art student visiting Mexico in "A Shot from Nowhere" sees a young boy killed but can get no one to do anything about it; he is arrested and thrown out of the country with no explanation. More mood pieces and psychological studies than nicely plotted stories, these tales are depressing and downbeat, albeit very well written.

Whites and yellows use only the tiny leaf bud. Whites are primarily made in mainland China, although some limited whites or silvertips are being made from Assam and Darjeeling teas to great effect. </p><p> Green Teas</p><p> Mainland China makes what are perhaps the world's finest greens-delicate, sweet, grassy, and palate cleansing-running the gamut from their famous Lung Ching (Dragonwell) to the fragrant, more intense tasting green Yunnan with hundreds, maybe thousands, of greens in between. </p><p> </p><p>Japanese green teas are lovely and exquisitely made. Green teas use the tenderest, youngest leaves and are steam dried and lightly shaped to retain not only their color but their intense spring-fresh flavor. The range is subtle but broad. From the delicate, sweet Gyokuro to the everyday refreshment of Sencha, Japanese greens are available in countless variations. Ones to seek out are the delicate Fukuyu, the light-tasting roasted teas like Hojicha and Bancha, or the delightful Genmaicha, made with rice and popcorn. All go so gently with Japanese foods and are nice counterpoints to spicy meals of other cuisines.</p><p> Black Teas</p><p> All tea was green tea before tea marketers realized that by drying the teas they could preserve them and lengthen their shelf life. So, ironically, now that green tea has regained its popularity, the largest producers of black teas, India and Sri Lanka, are now producing green teas. India's "new" greens retain the wonderful bite that characterizes its teas, and one can find them in Assam, Darjeeling, and now Nilgiri in limited quantities. All of these "new" greens are processed in the style of Chinese greens without any oxidation whatsoever. Sri Lanka's Ceylon greens are clean tasting, have a nice full-mouth feel, and go wonderfully with all foods </p><p>Black teas are 100 percent oxidized and are the world's most commonly drunk teas as single estates, blends, or flavored teas. Their intensity makes them good foils for sugar and milk. However, the better made blacks are smooth, rich, and highly aromatic plain. Blacks are available in full leaf, broken leaf, and crushed or ground in the manufacturing process, called CTC (crush, tear, cut). </p><p>From the naturally fruity Cameroon to the never-clouding Indian Nilgiri, black teas are wonderful for iced drinks and hot cups of brew. Tea grows in more than thirty-five countries these days, so one can enjoy blacks like a crisp Kenyan, a rich, hearty Indonesian, a winey Keemun, or fragrant Yunnan (also available in green) from China and begin a fascinating journey around the world tasting teas.</p><p> Oolong Teas</p><p> Oolongs are oxidized from 2 to 80 percent, thus retaining an incredible fragrance and aromatic taste in the cup. Their leaves are usually quite large and flavorful and can be reinfused several times. Taiwan is a premier processor of oolongs, which are known by the former country name of Formosa. The Fujian Province of mainland China produces some exquisite oolongs, for example Ti Kwan Yin, and oolongs are being made from exceptional India teas, particularly Darjeelings from Makaibari Tea Estates and other prestigious farms in that country.</p></p><h2>Garro (42) (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Battle-Captain.

Fine, A fine copy in black half-cloth boards, silver title on spine with a fine dust jacket.</p><p>Fifty years after his death, General George C. Patton Jr. remains one of the most colorful, charismatic, misunderstood and controversial figures ever to set foot on the battlefields of World War II. And the image of the man has been not a little influenced by the 1970 film <i>Patton</i>, starring George C. Scott, in which he is portrayed as a swashbuckling, brash, profane, impetuous general who wore ivory-handled pistols into battle and slapped two hospitalized soldiers in Sicily. <p>It is one of the achievements of this riveting biography that it reveals the complex and contradictory personality that lay behind the facade. With full access to Patton's private and public papers, and the cooperation of the general's family, Carlo D'Este shows us not only the extrovert Patton of public perception, but also the intensely private Patton -- the devoted student of history, the poet, the humble man very unsure of his own abilities -- who could burst into tears, be charming or insulting quite unexpectedly, and the Patton who trained himself for greatness with a determination matched by no other general in the twentieth century. D'Este describes Patton's patrician background with its strong military heritage in the Civil War on the Confederate side; his struggle to overcome dyslexia to get through West Point; his lifelong doubts about his own courage that forced him to take reckless chances; and the enduring and sometimes troubled marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Beatrice Ayer, daughter of a wealthy Boston family, who proved to be a tower of strength and devotion to a soldier husband who was miserable in peacetime. </p><p>This book also covers Patton's military career from his dramatic role in the 1916 campaign against Pancho Villa in northern Mexico to his service in France in World War I, where he organized and led the first U.S. tank corps at Saint-Mihiel and in the Meuse-Argonne offensive (where he was seriously wounded), to his frequently brilliant and occasionally very controversial roles during World War II in the fighting in North Africa, Sicily, France and Germany, where he earned the reputation of being the allied general the Germans most feared and respected. </p><p><i>Patton: A Genius for War</i> is a full-fledged portrait of an extraordinary American.</p>Carlo D'Este is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and a highly regarded military historian. He is the author of four books about World War II -- <i>Decision in Normandy, Bitter Victory: The Battle for Sicily, 1943, World War II in the Mediterranean,</i> and <i>Fatal Decision: Anzio and the Battle for Rome.</i> <p>D'Este received his B.A. from Norwich University in 1958, an M.A. from the University of Richmond in 1974, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Norwich in 1992. </p><p>Born in Oakland, California, D'Este now lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</p></p><h2>Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Rethinking the History, Science, and Meaning of Auditory Hallucination</h2><p>A history of auditory hallucination traces the medical community&#39;s understanding and treatment of the phenomenon throughout the ages while drawing on literary, psychological, and anthropological perspectives in order to shed light on how patients have managed and even found inspiration from related disorders.</p><p>Daniel B. Smith is a New York-based journalist and author. His work has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and <i>n+1</i>Smith's father and grandfather both heard voices, and thereby hangs the tale Smith tells at the outset, and also his interest in the phenomenon of hearing people speak when no one else can and without otherwise sensing them. Research indicates that hearing voices isn't all that rare; that many cope well with it, belying its association with madness; and that so many parts of the brain are involved in audition that finding those responsible for hearing voices may be impossible. Smith proceeds from present-day science to the nineteenth-century labeling of hearing voices as hallucinatory, and then to famous cases of it, most of them preceding but one during its pathologization. Socrates (Smith posits that the voices the philosopher heard affected his sentencing to death), Joan of Arc, and a German jurist who largely recovered from schizophrenic voice hearing are the three figures about whom Smith writes so intelligently and absorbingly that one wishes he had covered others he notes, especially William Blake, as fully.

Generations of readers and theatergoers have found relevance in Shaw's story of speech therapist Henry Higgins, who successfully transforms Liza Doolittle, a "draggle-tailed guttersnipe," into a darling of high society who momentarily upsets his hard-edged reserve.

In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br>The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made <i>Pygmalion</i> one of the most popular comedies in the English language.</p><p></p>One of Shaw's most enduring works, Pygmalion is an insightful comedy of class relations and perceptions, as played out between a Cockney flower girl and the irascible speech professor who has taken her on as a pet project.

Ondaatje's prose is at times startlingly lyrical, and as he chases Bolden through documents and scenes, the novel partakes of the very best sort of modern detective novel--one where the enigma is never resolved, but allowed to manifest in its fullness. Though more 'experimental' in form than either "The English Patient or "In the Skin of a Lion, it is a fitting addition to the renowned Ondaatje "oeuvre.At the turn of the century, the Storyville district of New Orleans had some 2,000 prostitutes, 70 professional gamblers, and 30 piano players. It had only one man who played the cornet like Buddy Bolden. By day he cut hair and purveyed gossip at N. Joseph&#39;s Shaving Parlor. At night he played jazz as though unleashing wild animals in a crowded room. At the age of thirty-one, Buddy Bolden went mad. From these sparse facts Michael Ondaatje has created a haunting, lushly atmospheric novel about one of jazz&#39;s legendary pioneers and martyrs. Obsessed with death, addicted to whiskey, and self-destructively in love with two women, Buddy Bolden embodies all the dire claims that music places on its acolytes. And as told in Coming Through Slaughter, his story is as beautiful and chilling as a New Orleans funeral procession, where even the mourners dance.</p><h2>Helicopters, Drill Sergeants &amp; Consultants: Parenting Styles and the Messages They Send</h2><p>I have two addictions- kids and psychology.

Latkes in Texas are seasoned with cilantro and cayenne pepper. Children in Cincinnati sing Hanukkah songs and eat oranges and ice cream. While each tradition springs from its own unique set of cultural references, what ties them together is that they all celebrate a holiday that is different in America than it is any place else. For the past two hundred years, American Jews have been transforming the ancient holiday of Hanukkah from a simple occasion into something grand. Each year, as they retell its story and enact its customs, they bring their ever-changing perspectives and desires to its celebration. Providing an attractive alternative to the Christian dominated December, rabbis and lay people alike have addressed contemporary hopes by fashioning an authentically Jewish festival that blossomed in their American world.</p><br><p>The ways in which Hanukkah was reshaped by American Jews reveals the changing goals and values that emerged among different contingents each December as they confronted the reality of living as a religious minority in the United States. Bringing together clergy and laity, artists and businessmen, teachers, parents, and children, Hanukkah has been a dynamic force for both stability and change in American Jewish life. The holiday&#x2019;s distinctive transformation from a minor festival to a major occasion that looms large in the American Jewish psyche is a marker of American Jewish life. Drawing on a varied archive of songs, plays, liturgy, sermons, and a range of illustrative material, as well as developing portraits of various communities, congregations, and rabbis, Hanukkah in America reveals how an almost forgotten festival became the most visible of American Jewish holidays.</p><br><p>New Books Network interviews Dianne Ashton</p></p><p><b>Dianne Ashton</b> is Professor of Religion Studies and former director of the American Studies program at Rowan University. She is the author of four books, including the first modern biography of the American Jewish education trailblazer, Rebecca Gratz (1997), and, with Ellen M. Umansky, the widely read Four Centuries of Jewish Women&#x2019;s Spirituality: A Sourcebook (revised 2009).She is currently editor of the scholarly journal, American Jewish History."Ashton offers us the most comprehensive history of Hanukkah to date . . . . It would be a joy to find this book nestled under one's Hanukkah bush or in front of the memorah." (Lisa Hoelle <i>Practical Matters</i>)<br><br>"Ashton's study reveals that the interactions between Jews and their American neighbors held the potential for inspiring Jews to reexamine their religious culture and redirect it toward bringing greater joy to American Jewish life. This 'Christmas effect' also demonstrates the complicated question of whether an innovation constitutes assimilation or 'Jewish renewal.' When was borrowing from the majority culture an act of 'selling out,' and when was it a means to finding a more meaningful solution? Jews in America have always wrestled with that dilemma and, perhaps, never more than during Hanukkah." (Rachel Gordan <i>The Marginalia Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"[T]his book is certainly a welcome and valuable contribution to the fields of American Jewish history and religious studies." (<i>The American Jewish Archives Journal</i>)<br><br>"Again and again . . . American Jews wove Hanukkah's story into their own contemporary lives in ways that reflected their changing circumstances. Those retellings kept Hanukkah's meaning alive and relevant. They turned the simple holiday rite into an event which, like other well-loved Jewish festivals, drew families together in their own homes where they could tailor the celebration to fit their own tastes in food and decor, and to reflect their own ideas about the holiday's significance" (<i>Jewish Book Council</i>)<br><br>"Children growing up in 21st-century America are encouraged to think that the December holiday season is an inclusive one, and that Christmas and Hanukkah celebrations carry equal import. Historically and liturgically, however, as many Jewish children learn after their bar or bat mitzvah, Hanukkah is a minor holiday, ginned up to compete with Christmass dominancea quandary known as the 'December dilemma.' Hanukkahs history was �manipulated: the celebration of an unlikely military victory of the �Maccabee-led Judean insurgents against Hellenic rule became a story, spurred on by Talmudic myth, of Gods intervention to make one flask of sacred oil burn for eight nights. Ashton offers readers a lively account of the holidays modern iterations. At various points, Hanukkah was a social enticement to join a Jewish congregation, a counterpoint to arguments that Jews were weak and a celebration to bond children to family. Hanukkah reflects both a general Jewish problem and a distinctly American one. On the one hand, it embodies the 'essential project of the rabbis: With the Temple destroyed, they aimed to make it possible for Jews to extend the spirituality of the Temple into their everyday lives.' On the other, for most of the 19th century, 'American Jewish life struggled along on the distant periphery of the Jewish world, an ocean away from the great centers of Jewish learning' and leadership. Celebrating Hanukkah in the home allowed the creation of an American Jewish tradition." (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Religiously, Hanukkah is considered a minor Jewish festival. Ashtons wonderfully readable, fact-packed history demonstrates, however, that in the U.S., Hanukkah isnt minor at all . . . . [T]he illustrations scattered throughout the text are always pertinent; andAshtons evenhandedness most admirable." (Ray Olson <i>STARRED Booklist</i>)<br><br>"A successful and accessible history, Ashton's book will appeal to general readers and specialists with an interest in American Jewish history." (Matt Rice <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"[T]his work shows how Jewish communities used 'an element within Judaism that corresponded to an element of Christianity in order to resist Christianity.' A fact-filled, mostly interesting account of Hanukkah's development in the United States." (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>"Hanukkah, traditionally a minor Jewish festival, grew like a beanstalk in America, becoming one of Judaisms most widely celebrated holidays. In this definitive history, Dianne Ashton explains how this happened, and what it teaches us about America, about religion, and about Jews." (Jonathan D.

And with every passing day, it became harder and harder to keep the memories clear in his head. <br>The fighting had started on July 28, 1914. Others might not have remembered that date so easily, but Alfie would never forget it, for that was his birthday. He had turned five years old that day and his parents threw him a party to celebrate, but only a handful of people showed up: Granny Summerfield, who sat in the corner, weeping into her handkerchief and saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished, we&#x2019;re all finished,&#x201d; over and over, until Alfie&#x2019;s mum said that if she couldn&#x2019;t get ahold of herself she would have to leave; Old Bill Hemperton, the Australian from next door, who was about a hundred years old and played a trick with his false teeth, sliding them in and out of his mouth using nothing but his tongue; Alfie&#x2019;s best friend, Kalena Jan�cek, who lived three doors down at number six, and her father, who ran the sweet shop on the corner and had the shiniest shoes in London. Alfie invited most of his friends from Damley Road, but that morning, one by one, their mothers knocked on the Summerfields&#x2019; front door and said that little so-and-so wouldn&#x2019;t be able to come. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a day for a party, is it?&#x201d; asked Mrs. Smythe from number nine, the mother of Henry Smythe, who sat in the seat in front of Alfie in school and made at least ten disgusting smells every day. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best if you just cancel it, dear.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not canceling anything,&#x201d; said Alfie&#x2019;s mother, Margie, throwing up her hands in frustration after the fifth parent had come to call. &#x201c;If anything, we should be doing our best to have a good time today. And what am I to do with all this grub if no one shows up?&#x201d; <br>Alfie followed her into the kitchen and looked at the table, where corned-beef sandwiches, stewed tripe, pickled eggs, cold tongue, and jellied eels were all laid out in a neat row, covered over with tea towels to keep them fresh. <br>&#x201c;I can eat it,&#x201d; said Alfie, who liked to be helpful. <br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; said Margie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you can. You&#x2019;re a bottomless pit, Alfie Summerfield. I don&#x2019;t know where you put it all. Honest, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>When Alfie&#x2019;s dad, Georgie, came home from work at lunchtime that day, he had a worried expression on his face. He didn&#x2019;t go out to the backyard to wash up like he usually did, even though he smelled a bit like milk and a bit like a horse. Instead, he stood in the front parlor reading a newspaper before folding it in half, hiding it under one of the sofa cushions, and coming into the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;All right, Margie,&#x201d; he said, pecking his wife on the cheek. <br>&#x201c;All right, Georgie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right, Alfie,&#x201d; he said, tousling the boy&#x2019;s hair. <br>&#x201c;All right, Dad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Happy birthday, son. What age are you now anyway, twenty-seven?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>five,</i>&#x201d; said Alfie, who couldn&#x2019;t imagine what it would be like to be twenty-seven but felt very grown up to think that he was five at last. <br>&#x201c;Five. I see,&#x201d; said Georgie, scratching his chin. &#x201c;Seems like you&#x2019;ve been around here a lot longer than that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Out! Out! Out!&#x201d; shouted Margie, waving her hands to usher them back into the front parlor. Alfie&#x2019;s mum always said there was nothing that annoyed her more than having her two men under her feet when she was trying to cook. And so Georgie and Alfie did what they were told, playing a game of Snakes and Ladders at the table by the window as they waited for the party to begin. <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; said Alfie. <br>&#x201c;Yes, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How was Mr. Asquith today?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Much better.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did the vet take a look at him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He did, yes. Whatever was wrong with him seems to have worked its way out of his system.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Asquith was Georgie&#x2019;s horse. Or rather he was the dairy&#x2019;s horse; the one who pulled Georgie&#x2019;s milk float every morning when he was delivering the milk. Alfie had named him the day he&#x2019;d been assigned to Georgie a year before; he&#x2019;d heard the name so often on the wireless radio that it seemed it could only belong to someone very important, and so he decided it was just right for a horse. <br>&#x201c;Did you give him a pat for me, Dad?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I did, son,&#x201d; said Georgie. <br>Alfie smiled. He loved Mr. Asquith. He absolutely loved him. <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; said Alfie a moment later. <br>&#x201c;Yes, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can I come to work with you tomorrow?&#x201d; <br>Georgie shook his head. &#x201c;Sorry, Alfie. You&#x2019;re still too young for the milk float. It&#x2019;s more dangerous than you realize.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you said that I could when I was older.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And when you&#x2019;re older, you can.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m older now,&#x201d; said Alfie. &#x201c;I could help all our neighbors when they come to fill their milk jugs at the float.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than my job&#x2019;s worth, Alfie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I could keep Mr. Asquith company while you filled them yourself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, son,&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re still not old enough.&#x201d; <br>Alfie sighed. There was nothing in the world he wanted more than to ride the milk float with his dad and help deliver the milk every morning, feeding lumps of sugar to Mr. Asquith between streets, even though it meant getting up in the middle of the night. The idea of being out in the streets and seeing the city when everyone else was still in bed sent a shiver down his spine. And being his dad&#x2019;s right-hand man? What could be better? He&#x2019;d asked whether he could do it at least a thousand times, but every time he asked, the answer was always the same: <i>Not yet, Alfie, you&#x2019;re still too young.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember when you were five?&#x201d; asked Alfie. <br>&#x201c;I do, son. That was the year my old man died. That was a rough year.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How did he die?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Down the mines.&#x201d; <br>Alfie thought about it. He knew only one person who had died. Kalena&#x2019;s mother, Mrs. Jan�cek, who had passed away from tuberculosis. Alfie could spell that word. <i>T-u-b-e-r-c-u-l-o-s-i-s.</i> <br>&#x201c;What happened then?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When your dad died.&#x201d; <br>Georgie thought about it for a moment and shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;Well, we moved to London, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your Granny Summerfield said there was nothing in Newcastle for us anymore. She said if we came here we could make a fresh start. She said I was the man of the house now.&#x201d; He threw a five and a six, landed on blue 37, and slid down a snake all the way to white 19. &#x201c;Just my luck,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be able to stay up late tonight, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Alfie asked, and his dad nodded. <br>&#x201c;Just for you, I will,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Since it&#x2019;s your birthday, I&#x2019;ll stay up till nine. How does that sound?&#x201d; <br>Alfie smiled; Georgie never went to bed any later than seven o&#x2019;clock at night because of his early starts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no good without my beauty sleep,&#x201d; he always said, which made Margie laugh, and then he would turn to Alfie and say, &#x201c;Your mum only agreed to marry me on account of my good looks. But if I don&#x2019;t get a decent night&#x2019;s sleep I get dark bags under my eyes and my face grows white as a ghost and she&#x2019;ll run off with the postman.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I ran off with a milkman, and much good it did me,&#x201d; Margie always said in reply, but she didn&#x2019;t mean it, because then they&#x2019;d look at each other and smile, and sometimes she would yawn and say that she fancied an early night too, and up they&#x2019;d go to bed, which meant Alfie had to go to bed too and this proved one thing to him: that yawning was contagious. <br>Despite the disappointing turnout for his birthday party, Alfie tried not to mind too much. He knew that something was going on out there in the real world, something that all the adults were talking about, but it seemed boring and he wasn&#x2019;t really interested anyway. There&#x2019;d been talk about it for months; the grown-ups were forever saying that something big was just around the corner, something that was going to affect them all. Sometimes Georgie would tell Margie that it was going to start any day now and they&#x2019;d have to be ready for it, and sometimes, when she got upset, he said that she had nothing to worry about, that everything would turn out tickety-boo in the end, and that Europe was far too civilized to start a scrap that no one could possibly hope to win. <br>When the party started, everyone tried to be cheerful and pretend that it was a day just like any other. They played Hot Potato, where everyone sat in a circle and passed a hot potato to the next person and the first to drop it was out. (Kalena won that game.) Old Bill Hemperton set up a game of Penny Pitch in the front parlor, and Alfie came away three farthings the richer. Granny Summerfield handed everyone a clothes peg and placed an empty milk bottle on the floor. Whoever could drop the peg into the bottle from the highest was the winner. (Margie was twice as good as everyone else at this.) But soon the adults stopped talking to the children and huddled together in corners with glum expressions on their faces while Alfie and Kalena listened in to their conversations and tried to understand what they were talking about. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re better off signing up now before they call you,&#x201d; Old Bill Hemperton said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll go easier on you in the end, you mark my words.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Be quiet, you,&#x201d; snapped Granny Summerfield, who lived in the house opposite Old Bill at number eleven and had never got along with him because he played his gramophone every morning with the windows open. She was a short, round woman who always wore a hairnet and kept her sleeves rolled up as if she were just about to go to work. &#x201c;Georgie&#x2019;s not signing up for anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Might not have a choice, Mum,&#x201d; said Georgie, shaking his head. <br>&#x201c;Shush&#x2014;not in front of Alfie,&#x201d; said Margie, tugging on his arm. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying that this thing could run and run for years. I might have a better chance if I volunteer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;ll all be over by Christmas,&#x201d; said Mr. Jan�cek, whose black leather shoes were so shiny that almost everyone had remarked upon them. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what everyone is saying.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shush&#x2014;not in front of Alfie,&#x201d; said Margie again, raising her voice now. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished, we&#x2019;re all finished!&#x201d; cried Granny Summerfield, taking her enormous handkerchief from her pocket and blowing her nose so loudly that Alfie burst out laughing. Margie didn&#x2019;t find it so funny, though; she started to cry and ran out of the room, and Georgie ran after her. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>More than four years had passed since that day, but Alfie still thought about it all the time. He was nine years old now and hadn&#x2019;t had any birthday parties in the years in between. But when he was going to sleep at night, he did his best to put together all the things he could remember about his family before they&#x2019;d changed, because if he remembered them the way they used to be, then there was always the chance that one day they could be that way again. <br>Georgie and Margie had been very old when they got married&#x2014;he knew that much. His dad had been almost twenty-one and his mum was only a year younger. Alfie found it hard to imagine what it would be like to be twenty-one years old. He thought that it would be difficult to hear things and that your sight would be a little fuzzy. He thought you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get up out of the broken armchair in front of the fireplace without groaning and saying, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s me turning in for the night then.&#x201d; He guessed that the most important things in the world to you would be a nice cup of tea, a comfortable pair of slippers, and a cozy cardigan. Sometimes when he thought about it, he knew that one day he would be twenty-one years old too, but it seemed so far in the future that it was hard to imagine. He&#x2019;d taken a piece of paper and pen once and written the numbers down, and he realized that it would be 1930 before he was that age. 1930! That was centuries away. All right, maybe not centuries, but that&#x2019;s the way Alfie thought about it. <br>Alfie&#x2019;s fifth birthday party was both a happy and a sad memory. It was happy because he&#x2019;d received some good presents: a set of eighteen different-colored crayons and a sketchbook from his parents; a secondhand copy of <i>The Life and Most Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</i> from Mr. Jan�cek, who said that it would probably be too difficult for him now but that he&#x2019;d be able to read it one day; a bag of sherbet lemons from Kalena. And he didn&#x2019;t mind that some of the presents were boring: a pair of socks from Granny Summerfield and a map of Australia from Old Bill Hemperton, who said that someday he might want to go Down Under, and if that day ever came, then this map was sure to come in handy. <br>&#x201c;See there?&#x201d; said Old Bill, pointing at a spot near the top of the map, where the green of the edges turned brown in the center. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from. A town called Mareeba. Finest little town in all of Australia. Anthills the size of houses. If you ever go there, Alfie, you tell them Old Bill Hemperton sent you, and they&#x2019;ll treat you like one of their own. I&#x2019;m a hero back there on account of my connections.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What connections?&#x201d; he asked, but Old Bill only winked and shook his head. <br>Alfie didn&#x2019;t know what to make of this, but in the days that followed he pinned the map to his bedroom wall anyway, he wore the socks that Granny Summerfield had given him, he used most of the coloring pencils and all of the sketchbook, he tried to read <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> but struggled with it (although he put it on his shelf to come back to when he was older), and he shared the sherbet lemons with Kalena. <br>These were the good memories. <br>The sad ones existed because that was when everything had changed. All the men from Damley Road had gathered outside on the street as the sun went down, their shirtsleeves rolled up, tugging at their braces as they spoke about things they called &#x201c;duty&#x201d; and &#x201c;responsibility,&#x201d; taking little puffs of their cigarettes before pinching the tips closed again and putting the butts back in their waistcoat pockets for later on. Georgie had got into an argument with his oldest and closest friend, Joe Patience, who lived at number sixteen, about what they called the rights and wrongs of it all. Joe and Georgie had been friends since Georgie and Granny Summerfield moved to Damley Road&#x2014;Granny Summerfield said that Joe had practically grown up in her kitchen&#x2014;and had never exchanged a cross word until that afternoon. It was the day when Charlie Slipton, the paper boy from number twenty-one, who&#x2019;d once thrown a stone at Alfie&#x2019;s head for no reason whatsoever, had come up and down the street six times with later and later editions of the newspaper, and managed to sell them all without even trying. And it was the day that had ended with Alfie&#x2019;s mum sitting in the broken armchair in front of the fireplace, sobbing as if the end of the world was upon them. <br>&#x201c;Come on, Margie,&#x201d; Georgie said, standing behind her and rubbing her neck. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to cry about, is there? Remember what everyone said&#x2014;it&#x2019;ll all be over by Christmas. I&#x2019;ll be back here in time to help stuff the goose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you believe that, do you?&#x201d; Margie said, looking up at him, her eyes red-rimmed with tears. &#x201c;You believe what they tell you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What else can we do but believe?&#x201d; said Georgie. &#x201c;We have to hope for the best.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Promise me, Georgie Summerfield,&#x201d; said Margie. &#x201c;Promise me you won&#x2019;t sign up.&#x201d; <br>There was a long pause before Alfie&#x2019;s dad spoke again. &#x201c;You heard what Old Bill said, love. It might be easier on me in the long term if&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what about me? And Alfie? Will it be easier on us? Promise me, Georgie!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right, love. Let&#x2019;s just see what happens, shall we? All them politicians might wake up tomorrow morning and change their minds about the whole thing anyway. We could be worrying over nothing.&#x201d; <br>Alfie wasn&#x2019;t su...</p><h2>Canyon Country Wildflowers: A Guide To Common Wildflowers, Shrubs, And Trees (Wildflower Series)</h2><p><p>Fully revised and published in cooperation with Canyonlands Natural History Association, <i>Canyon Country Wildflowers</i> is a comprehensive field guide to the diverse flora of the&nbsp;Four-corners area of the U.S., including Arches and Canyonlands National&nbsp;Parks.

SIGNED by Munro on the title page.</p><p>In the world of Alice Munro, the best route is not necessarily the shortest distance between two points. In her ninth superlative collection of short fiction, <i>The Love of a Good Woman</i>, the setting is once again western Canada, and the subject matter is classic Munro: secrets, love, betrayal, and the stuff of ordinary lives. But as is usual for this master of the short form, the path she takes is anything but ordinary. The stunning title story is a case in point. A narrative in four parts, it begins with the drowning of a small-town optometrist and ripples outward, touching first the boys who find the body, then a spiteful dying woman and her young practical nurse. Whose tale <i>is</i> this, anyway? Not the optometrist's, surely, though his death holds it together. The effect is not exactly <i>Rashomon</i>-like either, though each of the sections views him through a different eye. Instead, "The Love of a Good Woman" is as thorough and inclusive a portrait of small-town life as can be imagined--its tensions and its deceit, its involuntary bonds. Within its 75 pages it encompasses a world more capacious than that of most novels.<p> As always, Munro's prose is both simple and moving, as when the letter-writing protagonist of "Before the Change" sends her love to an ex-fianc�: </p><blockquote> What if people really did that--sent their love through the mail to get rid of it? What would it be that they sent? A box of chocolates with centers like the yolks of turkey's eggs. A mud doll with hollow eye sockets. A heap of roses slightly more fragrant than rotten. A package wrapped in bloody newspaper that nobody would want to open. </blockquote> The fictions in this volume burn with a kind of dry-eyed anti-romanticism--even the ones whose plots verge on domestic melodrama (a baby's near-death in "My Mother's Dream"; an adulterous wife in "The Children Stay"). Densely populated, elliptical in construction, each story circles around its principal events and relationships like planets around a sun. The result is layered and complex, its patterns not always apparent on first reading: in other words, something like life. <i>--Mary Park</i>Superb...Long ago, Virginia Woolf described George Eliot as one of the few writers 'for grown-up people.'

MacDonald (1916-1986) MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pa, and educated at the Universities of Pennsylvania, Syracuse and Harvard, where he took an MBA in 1939. After war service in the Far East he wrote hundreds of stories for the pulps and over seventy novels, including the 21 in the Travis McGee sequence.One<br> On the most beautiful day any April could be asked to come up with, I was kneeling in eight inches of oily water in the cramped bilge of Meyer&#x2019;s squatty little cabin cruiser, the <i>John Maynard Keynes,</i> taking his automatic bilge pump apart for the third time in an hour.<br> The socket wrench slipped, and I skinned yet another knuckle. Meyer stood blocking out a sizable piece of the deep blue sky. He stared down into the bilge and said, &#x201c;Very inventive and very fluent. Nice mental images, Travis. Imagine one frail little bilge pump performing such an extraordinary act upon itself! But you began to repeat yourself toward the end.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Would you like to crawl down in here and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> He backed up a hasty half step. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t deprive you of the pleasure. You said you could fix it. Go ahead.&#x201d;<br> I got it apart again. I spun the little impeller blade and suddenly realized that maybe it turned too freely. Found the set screw would take a full turn. Tightened it back down onto the shaft. Reassembled the crummy little monster, bolted it down underwater, heaved myself up out of the water, sat on the edge of the hatch, and had Meyer flip the switch. It started to make a nice steady wheeeeeeng, gouting dirty bilge water into the Bahia Mar yacht basin.<br> Meyer started to applaud, and I told him to save it until we found out if the adorable thing would turn itself the hell off like it says in the fine print. It took a good ten minutes to pump the water out. Then it went weeeeeeng-guggle-chud. Silence.<br> &#x201c;Now cheer,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Hooray,&#x201d; he said mildly. &#x201c;Thank you very much and hooray.&#x201d; I looked at him with exasperation and affection. My mild and bulky friend with the wise little blue eyes, bright and bemused, and with the bear hair, thatch black, curling out of the throat of his blue knit shirt.<br> &#x201c;Another half inch of rain last night,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;and you could have gone down like a stone.&#x201d;<br> He had stepped out of his bunk in the dark after the rain stopped and into ankle deep water. He had sloshed over to my houseboat, the <i>Busted Flush,</i> and told me he had a small problem. At three in the morning we had toted my auxiliary pump over and set it on the dock and dropped the intake hose into his bilge. His home and refuge was very low in the water, the mooring lines taut enough to hum when plucked. By first light the <i>Keynes</i> was floating high again, and we could turn the pump off and carry it back. Now the repaired automatic bilge pump had taken out the last of the water, but he was going to live in dampness for quite a while.<br> &#x201c;Perils of the sea,&#x201d; he said.<br> I stepped up onto the dock and squatted and began to rinse the grease and bilge water off my hands under the hose faucet. Meyer shaded his eyes and looked toward the <i>Flush</i>. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a visitor, Travis. Isn&#x2019;t that what&#x2019;s-his-name?&#x201d;<br> I stood up and stared. &#x201c;It sure is. Good old what&#x2019;s-his-name. Harry Broll. Do you think that son of a bitch has come to try me again?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;After the showing last time . . . Was it two years ago?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;At least.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s at least bright enough not to try again.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not the same way. But he did catch me with one very nice left. True, he broke his hand, but it was one to re�member.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Want company?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d;<br> Harry turned and saw me when I was about fifty feet away. He was big, and he had gotten bigger since I&#x2019;d seen him last. More gut and more jowls. Not becoming. He wore a pale beige suit, a yellow shirt, and he had a chocolate-�colored neckerchief with an ornate, gold slip ring.<br> He raised his hands in the most primitive gesture of reassurance. Palms out. Sickly smile to go with it. As I came up to him he said, &#x201c;Hi, McGee.&#x201d; He put his hand out. I looked at it until he pulled it back. He tried to laugh. &#x201c;Jesus, are you still sore?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sore, Harry. Why should we shake hands?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Look. I want to talk to you. Are you busy or anything?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What about?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About Mary. I know you&#x2019;ve got no reason in the world to do me any favors. But this concerns . . . Mary&#x2019;s well-�being.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is something wrong with her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t really know.&#x201d;<br> I studied him. He seemed concerned and upset. He had the pallor of desk work. His black hair had receded since I had seen him last. He said, &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t think of anybody else to come to. I can say please if it&#x2019;ll help. Please?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Come on aboard.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. Thanks a lot.&#x201d;<br> We went into the lounge. I had on an old pair of denim shorts and nothing else. The air-conditioning cooled the sweat on my shoulders and chest. He looked around, nodding and beaming, and said, &#x201c;Nice. Real nice. A nice way to live, huh?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Want a drink?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Bourbon, if you&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;On the rocks.&#x201d;<br> I put out the bottle and the glass and said, glancing down at my soiled hands, &#x201c;Ice is in the bin there. Help yourself while I clean up, Broll.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. You sure keep yourself in shape, McGee. Wish I had the time. I guess I better make sure I have the time one of these days.&#x201d;<br> I shrugged and went forward, dropped the shorts into the hamper and stepped into the oversized shower, thinking about Mary and wondering about her as I sudsed and scrubbed away the rest of the grime from the repair job. Miss Mary Dillon when I had known her. Then abruptly&#x2014;maybe too abruptly&#x2014;Mrs. Harry Broll. When I put my watch back on I saw that it was nearly four o&#x2019;clock. Meyer and I were invited for drinks at six aboard the <i>Jilly III</i>. I put on fresh slacks, an oyster-white sailcloth sports shirt, my ancient Mexican sandals. On the way back to the lounge I stopped in the galley and put some Plymouth on the rocks.<br> He was sitting on the yellow couch, and he had lit a small&nbsp;cigar with a white plastic mouthpiece. &#x201c;It must really be something, being able to just take off any time you feel like it.&#x201d;<br> I slouched into a chair facing him, took a swallow of my drink, and put it on the coffee table. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a problem, Harry?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About that time I made such a damn fool of myself . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Forget it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No. Please. Let me say something about that. Like they say, the first year of marriage is the hardest, right?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, I knew you and Mary were old friends. I couldn&#x2019;t help knowing that, right? I mean, you and Meyer came to the wedding and all. I wondered how good friends you had been. I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering, but I didn&#x2019;t want to really know. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The way it happened, we got into a hassle. It was the first real one we&#x2019;d had. People shouldn&#x2019;t drink and fight when they&#x2019;re married. They say things they don&#x2019;t want to say. I started saying some pretty ugly things about her and you. You know Mary. She&#x2019;s got a lot of spirit. She took it and took it, and finally she let me have it right between the eyes. I deserved it. She blazed right up at me. She said she&#x2019;d been cruising with you alone aboard this houseboat, down through the Keys and up the west coast to Tampa Bay, and she&#x2019;d lived aboard for a month and cooked your food and washed your clothes and slept in your bed, and you were kind and decent and gentle and twice the man I am. So that Sunday afternoon I slammed out of the house and got in the car and came over here to beat on you. I could always handle myself pretty good. I wasn&#x2019;t drunk enough for that to be any excuse. Jesus, I never hit so many arms and elbows and shoulders in my life.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And the top of my head.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what popped the knuckles. Look. This knuckle is still sort of sunk in. How many times did you hit me? Do you know?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure I know. Twice.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Twice,&#x201d; he said dolefully. &#x201c;Oh, shit.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I waited until you ran out of steam, Harry. I waited until you got arm weary.&#x201d;<br> He looked at me in an appraising way. &#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d done more good.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I had a pair of sore arms. You bruised me up, Harry. And a three-day headache.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess I had to get it out of my system. Do you understand it&#x2019;s still pretty hard for me to come to you to ask for anything?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I suppose it might be.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Mary kept telling me to grow up. Okay. I&#x2019;m trying to grow up. I&#x2019;m trying to be a mature, rational human being. Like they say, I&#x2019;ve been examining my priorities and my �options.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good for you. But where do I fit in?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I want you to tell Mary.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Give me a chance. Okay? Tell her that as soon as the SeaGate project is all set up, I think we ought to get away, just the two of us. A cruise or fly over to Spain, whatever. And tell her that the Canadian girl didn&#x2019;t mean a damn thing to me, that I didn&#x2019;t bring her back down here or ask her down, that she came on her own. And tell her to please get in touch with me so we can talk.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hold it! I don&#x2019;t know where Mary is.&#x201d;<br> His face turned red. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me such crap. You willing to let me search this houseboat?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t here, you damn fool.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find something of hers. Clothes, lipstick, something.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Harry. Jesus. Look around all you want.&#x201d;<br> He settled back in the chair. &#x201c;Okay. You and Mary knew I&#x2019;d come here sooner or later. So you haven&#x2019;t been having your fun aboard this boat.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s called paranoia, old buddy. When did she leave you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;January fifth.&#x201d;<br> I stared at him in disbelief. &#x201c;This is the fourteenth day of April. You have a slow reaction time.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been hoping she&#x2019;d come back or get in touch. Tell her how much I&#x2019;ve been hoping. She caught me dead to rights. She went around the house with a face like a stone for nearly two weeks, then when I got home that Tuesday, she&#x2019;d packed and left. No note, even. I went down the list of her friends and called them. It was humiliating for me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I bet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Now just one damn minute&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What makes you think she&#x2019;d come to me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I thought about it. I mean, back in January. It seemed like the most likely thing for her to do. I spent a whole weekend hanging around here. You had . . . another friend. So I decided if Mary had come here, she&#x2019;d found you were busy, gone someplace else.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t come here, Harry.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not right away.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What is that supposed to mean?&#x201d;<br> He leaned forward. &#x201c;Okay. Where were you at ten o&#x2019;clock on Friday morning, April second?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You and Mary came off this houseboat at ten that morning, and you went out to the parking lot and got into a white Ford LTD convertible with rental plates. A friend of mine happened to be here and happened to see the two of you get in and drive off. This friend followed you. You went over to the Parkway and turned south toward Miami, and he came back, and he phoned me about it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Are you willing to listen a minute? Are you willing to try to listen?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;All I know is my wife left me and she&#x2019;s sleeping with you, McGee, and I&#x2019;d like to see you dead.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The woman I was with is about Mary&#x2019;s height, and her figure is just as good, at least as good as Mary&#x2019;s used to be. Her hair is dark like Mary&#x2019;s. The woman is an old friend. That&#x2019;s her rental convertible, and it&#x2019;s still out there on the lot. With her hair in a scarf and dark glasses, she was all prepared for a trip in an open car. She&#x2019;s here aboard her boat. Her name is Jillian Brent-Archer. I haven&#x2019;t seen Mary since the wedding. Not once, Broll. And that was better than three years ago.&#x201d;<br> He looked at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re real cute, McGee. Jesus, you&#x2019;re cute. Most of the damn fools in this world would believe you. Are you going to tell Mary what I told you to tell her, what I&#x2019;ve begged you to tell her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How can I, when I don&#x2019;t even know . . .&#x201d;<br> And the dumb little weapon came out from under his clothes somewhere, maybe from the waist area, wedged between the belt and the flab. A dumb little automatic pistol in blued steel, half-swallowed in his big, pale, meaty fist. His staring eyes were wet with tears, and his mouth was twisted downward at the corners. The muzzle was making a ragged little circle, and a remote part of my mind identified it as .25 or .32 caliber, there not being all that much difference between a quarter of an inch diameter and a third of an inch. There was a sour laugh back in another compartment of my skull. This could very possibly be the end of it, a long-odds chance of a mortal wound at the hand of a jealous husband wielding something just a little bit better than a cap gun. The ragged circle took in my heart, brain, and certain essential viscera. And I was slouched deep in a chair facing him, just a little too far away to try to kick his wrist. He was going to talk or shoot. I saw his finger getting whiter, so I knew it was shoot.<br> I shoved with my heels and went over backward in the chair. The weapon made a noise like somebody slapping shingles together. My left heel went numb. I rolled to my right, knocked over a small table, fielded the chunky glass ashtray on the first bounce, rolled up onto my knees, and slung it underhand at his head as he came up out of the depths of the yellow couch. I missed him shamefully, and was caught there too close to him as he aimed at the middle of my face from five feet away and tried to pull the trigger. But the slide was all the way back, the clip empty.<br> I got slowly up onto very wobbly knees as Harry Broll lowered the gun to his side, relaxed his hand, let it fall. My heel tingled. A slug had grooved the hard leather on the bottom of the heel. The lounge smelled like the Fourth of July.<br> Harry&#x2019;s big face wrinkled like a slapped baby, and he took a half step toward me, arms half reaching out for comfort and forgiveness, and then he plumped back down on the couch and bellowed once, a walrus on a lonely strand.<br> My drink was gone, spilling when the table went over. I moved cautiously, checking myself for any area that might feel dead and damp. That is the bullet feel, dead, damp, and strange, before the torn nerves and muscles catch up and begin screaming. No such areas. I made tall careful steps into the galley, made a new drink. I went back in. Harry Broll sat with face in hands, snuffling drearily. The paper had kept me aware of him over the years. Broll plans new condominium complex. Broll given zoning board exception. Broll unveils shopping plaza concept. Chamber lauds Broll.<br> I sat opposite him again after putting the chair back on its legs. Looking around, I could count five ejected cartridge cases.<br> &#x201c;How old are you, Harry?&#x201d;<br> He sighed and mumbled it into his hands. &#x201c;Thirty-five.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You look fifty.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Get off my back.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too soft and too heavy. You sweat a lot, and you&#x2019;re short of breath, and your teeth need cleaning.&#x201d;<br> He lifted his mottled face and stared at me. &#x201c;Why are you saying these things?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe if you hadn&#x2019;t gotten so sloppy, Mary could have given you a second chance. Or maybe it was already a second chance.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, no. I don&#x2019;t play around. Jesus, I haven&#x2019;t had the time or the energy. This was the first time, I swear.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t play around, and you don&#x2019;t go around killing people.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You pushed me too far and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You always carry that thing?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You brought it along in case you felt like killing me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thank God, I missed you. I&#x2019;m not thinking right lately. Everything would have gone down the drain. Everything.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It would sort of spoil my day, too.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know, when a man takes a good look at himself, he begins to wonder why. You know? I&#x2019;ve been pushing myself hard. ...</p><h2>For Discrimination: Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law</h2><p><p>In the wake of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s recent decision regarding <i>Fisher v. University of Texas,</i> <i>For Discrimination</i> is at once the definitive reckoning with one of America&#x2019;s most explosively contentious and divisive issues and a principled work of advocacy for clearly defined justice. <br>&nbsp;<br>What precisely is affirmative action, and why is it fiercely championed by some and just as fiercely denounced by others? Does it signify a boon or a stigma? Or is it simply reverse discrimination? What are its benefits and costs to American society? What are the exact indicia determining who should or should not be accorded affirmative action? When should affirmative action end, if it must? Randall Kennedy, Harvard Law School professor and author of such critically acclaimed and provocative books as <i>Race, Crime, and the Law </i>and the national best-seller <i>Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word,</i> gives us a concise, gimlet-eyed, and deeply personal conspectus of the policy, refusing to shy away from the myriad complexities of an issue that continues to bedevil American race relations.<br>&nbsp;<br>With pellucid reasoning, Kennedy accounts for the slipperiness of the term &#x201c;affirmative action&#x201d; as it has been appropriated by ideologues of every stripe; delves into the complex and surprising legal history of the policy; coolly analyzes key arguments pro and con advanced by the left and right, including the so-called color-blind, race-neutral challenge; critiques the impact of Supreme Court decisions on higher education; and ponders the future of affirmative action.</p></p><p><p><b>Randall Kennedy</b> is the Michael R.

Ironically, as a nine-year-old, I perceived that Jim Crow arrangement as favoring blacks; it was far easier for us to throw candy down on the whites seated below than for them to throw things up at us. Back then, I thought that Americans were divided into teams designated by complexion. State authorities fed this perception with a chain in the middle of the road that separated whites and blacks in the area where my aunt lived, the choice to close rather than desegregate public parks, and ordinances requiring racially separate bathrooms (especially memorable for me were the signs differentiating &#x201c;white ladies&#x201d; from &#x201c;black women&#x201d;).<br><br>I was born in Columbia in 1954, the year the Supreme Court invalidated racial segregation in public schools. I visited frequently but did not live there. Fleeing racism like many millions of other Southern black refugees, my parents raised me and my siblings in Washington, D.C. My father once told me he feared that if he remained in the Deep South, he would kill or be killed in a racial altercation. He was a postal clerk who attended a couple of years of college at two black institutions: Dillard University, in New Orleans, and Southern University, in Baton Rouge. My mother was a schoolteacher who earned an undergraduate degree from South Carolina State College, an institution created for Negroes in order to &#x201c;protect&#x201d; the state&#x2019;s white university. When she sought a higher degree, she learned that that sort of study was unavailable to her in her home state. To fulfill what they perceived as their obligation under &#x201c;separate but equal,&#x201d; state authorities subsidized her tuition so that my mother could study &#x201c;abroad&#x201d; at some institution that would accept blacks. That is how she wound up as a student at New York University, where she earned a master&#x2019;s degree.<br><br>Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, I enjoyed a happy childhood in a loving household. By moving north, my family did not wholly escape racism; anti-black attitudes and practices were (and are) a national phenomenon. But what we encountered in D.C. paled in comparison with what my extended family faced in South Carolina; one of my cousins was at the civil rights protest at South Carolina State College in which three undergraduates were murdered by state police in an episode of racially motivated violence that, while the subject of a fine book, has never received the attention it warranted.<br><br>In my house, discussion about the civil rights movement was constant. From my parents I learned to revere well-known heroes and heroines&#x2014;Martin Luther King, Jr.; Rosa Parks; Fannie Lou Hamer&#x2014;as well as lesser-known figures like James Hinton, Modjeska Simkins, and Matthew Perry. Subsequently, I have come to appreciate with ever-deepening gratitude the benefits they pried open and that I have enjoyed as a matter of course. For one thing, I have had the privilege of attending an extraordinary array of schools that became accessible to more than a negligible number of black students only after the late 1960s: St. Albans School for Boys (1968&#x2013;73), Princeton University (1973&#x2013;77), and Yale Law School (1979&#x2013;82). An affirmative action ethos played a role in my admittance and flourishing at each of these selective, expensive, and powerful institutions. This ethos consists of a desire to make amends for past injustices, a commitment to counter present but hidden prejudices, a wish to forestall social disruption, and an intuition that racial integration will enrich institutions from which marginalized groups have largely been absent.<br><br>Of course, I encountered invidious racial discrimination in these schools periodically, but, luckily for me, the balance of my encounters along the race line were positive. I have often been shown special attention in competitive settings in which my blackness was perceived as a plus. I am quite certain that my race played a role in prompting teachers at St. Albans&#x2014;the most formative of the schools I attended&#x2014;to be especially helpful to me during my days as a student there. The same was true at Prince-ton, where I enjoyed the solicitude of William Bowen, who was then the president of the university, and Neil Rudenstine, the university provost (and later the president of Harvard). Their generosity was due, in part, to the mysterious alchemy of friendship. It was also due to their self-conscious, systematic efforts to lend special aid to promising scholars of color in America and indeed around the world. Throughout their distinguished careers, Bowen and Rudenstine have been highly effective practitioners of the affirmative action ethos.<br><br>When I was a senior in college, considering law school, I attended a gathering that featured the Yale Law School dean of admissions. He distributed a document that included a chart noting the range of Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores of the students in the most recent entering class. I had just received my LSAT results. My score was disappointing&#x2014;low enough that it did not even appear on the chart. I waited until the dean had fielded all of the other students&#x2019; questions before I bashfully approached him and asked whether, given my score, I should still apply. He asked what sort of grades I had earned. When I told him that I had an A-minus average, he urged me to proceed. I won admission to Yale, Harvard, and every other school to which I applied. I had the profile of a hard worker, and I also had a halo over me, having just won a Rhodes scholarship. In other words, without affirmative action I would surely have gained admission to a fine law school. But in its absence, and in the face of that spectacularly mediocre LSAT score, would I have gained admission to Yale and Harvard? Maybe not.<br><br>I attended Yale Law School (YLS) in the aftermath of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978). In that landmark ruling, the Supreme Court invalidated a particular affirmative action program but upheld affirmative action in university admissions in general, if structured in a certain way and pursued for the sake of &#x201c;diversity.&#x201d; At YLS, virtually all black students supported affirmative action. Doing so was seen as a sacred communal obligation. A memorable dinnertime discussion with black peers in my first year involved the question of what to do when Bakke became the subject of inquiry in class. One upperclassman (who has subsequently distinguished himself in government service and business) argued passionately that the case allowed for only one defensible outcome: he maintained that we ought not allow Bakke to be debated, because our presence at the school should not be subject to debate. He recommended that we walk out of class if opposition to affirmative action was voiced. I recall thinking at the time that that advice was silly. How else were we&#x2014;aspiring lawyers&#x2014;to master the arguments and counterarguments regarding affirmative action other than by engaging antagonists? But I also remember biting my tongue; as a newcomer, I thought it prudent to be quiet until I got a better sense of my surroundings.<br><br>Affirmative action figured, too, in another episode that remains vivid for me decades later. In my second year, in the introductory course on taxation, a black student was the first person called on. There were only two or three other black students in that class, and I made it a point to speak with them afterwards. I wanted to know whether they had felt as anxious as I had when our black classmate was called upon and whether they had felt as relieved as I had when she displayed mastery of the relevant material. They told me that they, too, had felt personally implicated by her performance and that they, too, had cheered silently when she answered commendably, putting &#x201c;the race&#x201d; in a good light. The perception of linked fate and that feeling of being always on the spot as a representative of the race, at least in mixed company, are features of African American life that predate affirmative action and arise outside of its presence. They are accentuated, however, in settings in which affirmative action is salient.<br><br>In law school, I earned the respect of professors and served on the editorial board of The Yale Law Journal. My most instructive and inspiring experience during law school was working at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF). There I had the good fortune of meeting an array of wonderful attorneys, including Jack Greenberg, who offered me a position at LDF. I would have accepted the offer but for the intervention of James Vorenberg, dean of Harvard Law School. He called me near the end of my final year at Yale to ask whether I had considered a career in legal academia. I told him that I had not but that I was open to thinking about it. Dean Vorenberg invited me to Harvard to talk with him, and I did so on several occasions during the postgraduate years when I served as a law clerk for Judge J. Skelly Wright of the United States Court of Appeals and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court. Vorenberg and his colleagues convinced me that a career as a law school professor would be fun and fulfilling.<br><br>This recruitment was highly unusual. Rarely does Harvard seek to persuade someone to apply for a faculty position. Dean Vorenberg and his colleagues did so in my case because influential professors at Yale had touted me, because I had written essays that appeared in a number of national publications, and because of the prestige in academic circles of the judges for whom I was clerking. They also took extra steps to recruit me because they wanted to add some color to a faculty that, in the mid-1980s, included only one African American and no Latinos, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. During the two years before my arrival, in 1984, the campus had been beset by highly publicized protests in which a substantial number of students and a small number of faculty members accused the law school administration of discriminating against minority academics of color or failing to reach out sufficiently to recruit them.<br><br>Affirmative action played a role not only in eliciting my candidacy; it played a role, too, in the ultimate determination to make me an offer. Was I &#x201c;qualified&#x201d;? Sure, I was. Indeed, I was highly qualified. But so, too, were still stronger candidates, probably all of whom were white. Top law schools search not merely for those who are highly qualified; they search for the most outstanding among the best qualified. I doubt that I measured up to that standard. To obtain an offer, I needed and received a boost from affirmative action. A race-sensitive desire to assist a promising black scholar, along with my own hard-earned skills and credentials, helped me gain admission to a faculty that otherwise would probably have been outside my reach.<br><br>Affirmative action has also buoyed my professional career. In 1998, I was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, two of the country&#x2019;s most prestigious honorific academic societies. By that point I had built a record of which I could justly be proud, including articles in leading law reviews and an award-winning book. Still, racial considerations explain in part why I was honored ahead of others, senior to me, who had deeper, more distinguished records than mine. Having snubbed outstanding black scholars in previous eras, the American Academy and similar organizations are using blacks like me to make amends and to serve other functions.<br><br>I do not feel belittled by this. Nor am I wracked by angst or guilt or self-doubt. I applaud the effort to rectify wrongs and extend and deepen desegregation in every aspect of American life.<br><br>There will be those, I suspect, who will put a mental asterisk next to my name upon learning that my race (almost certainly) counted as a plus in the process of selecting me for induction into these organizations. If they do, then they should also insist upon putting a mental asterisk next to the name of any white person who prevailed in any competition from which racial minorities were excluded. The distinguished historian Eric Foner highlights this point nicely, noting that when he graduated from Columbia College at Columbia University in 1963, his class was all male and virtually all white. &#x201c;Most of us,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;were young men of ability, yet had we been forced to compete for admission with women and racial minorities, fewer than half of us would have been at Columbia.&#x201d; Still, he observes, &#x201c;none of us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suffered debilitating self-doubt because we were the beneficiaries of affirmative action&#x2014;that is, favored treatment on the basis of our race and gender.&#x201d; Many Americans misconceive achievement, attributing it entirely to individual effort and talent. In reality, though, achievement stems from many sources: individual effort, to be sure, but also luck (the good fortune to have a healthy body and mind) and social support (family, schools, parks, libraries, laboratories). In assessing my own record, I try to maintain equanimity, knowing that on account of race I have sometimes been penalized and sometimes been preferred. I do my best and hope that my work meets high standards. I realize, though, that judgment is social, contingent, and subject to forces beyond my control.</p></p><h2>Learning to Lead: How to Bring Out the Best in People</h2><p>Despite the jokes about &#34;too many chiefs and not enough Indians,&#34; genuine leadership is in short supply in most churches. &#34;Leadership,&#34; according to Fred Smith, &#34;is what enables any group to bridge the chasm between where they are and where they should be. Crossing the Red sea, passing through the desert, or facing any immediate difficulty, a group needs leadership to make progress.&#34; True leaders attract followers and bring out the best in them. This book offers fresh insight into what leadership demands and suggests practical ways to become a better leader--of yourself, of your co-workers, of your congregation. It is for those who recognize that leadership is important for any church to grow and penetrate the community.</p><p></p><h2>Giraffes Can&#39;t Dance: Pop-Up- 15th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The Pop-Up Giraffes Can&#39;t Dance is now back with a wonderful foiled cover as part of the 15th Anniversary celebrations! Gerald would love to join in with the other animals at the Jungle Dance but everyone knows that giraffes can&#39;t dance . . . or can they? This classic and bestselling picture book, with its fabulous story about daring to be different, is brought gloriously to life in this sturdy and irresistible pop-up book.</p><p>Gerald the giraffe doesn't really have delusions of grandeur. He just wants to dance. But his knees are crooked and his legs are thin, and all the other animals mock him when he approaches the dance floor at the annual Jungle Dance. "Hey, look at clumsy Gerald," they sneer. "Oh, Gerald, you're so weird." Poor Gerald slinks away as the chimps cha-cha, rhinos rock 'n' roll, and warthogs waltz. But an encouraging word from an unlikely source shows this glum giraffe that those who are different "just need a different song," and soon he is prancing and sashaying and boogying to moon music (with a cricket accompanist). In the vein of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>, Gerald's fickle "friends" quickly decide he's worthy of their attention again. <p> With this rhyming, poignant (in a cartoonish way) tale, Giles Andreae, author of <i>Rumble in the Jungle</i>, and numerous other picture books, shows insecure young readers that everyone can be wonderful, even those that march to the beat of a different cricket. The rhymes are somewhat awkward, but the bold, bright watercolors by Guy Parker-Rees will invite readers to kick up their heels and find their own internal harmony.

Chesterton with the Ten Commandments. The connection is often surprising, however, for the criminal is not necessarily the worst sinner in the story, nor is his crime necessarily the worst offense.</p><p>When Chesterton created the character of Father Brown, he brought a new dimension to mystery stories&#x2015;the distinction between crime and sin. As the priest-detective applies his powers of observation to solve a case, he picks up clues about other offenses, such as those against the Sabbath or one's parents. Father Brown's main concern is not the laws of the State but the Commandments of God.</p><p>As Dorothy Sayers once wrote, G.K. Chesterton was "the first man of our time to introduce the great name of God into a detective story . . . to enlarge the boundaries of the detective story by making it deal with death and real wickedness and real, that is to say, divine judgment."</p><p>This edition includes footnotes not available in other versions, which help to clarify the literary and historical allusions made by Father Brown. It is based on the texts of Chesterton's original editions, for assurance of authenticity, and is set in easily readable type.</p></p><p><p><b>G. K. Chesterton</b>&nbsp;was one of the most beloved and prolific authors of the twentieth century. He wrote dozens of popular books on a variety of topics and thousands of essays. His books include&nbsp;<i>Orthodoxy</i>,<i> The Everlasting Man</i>,&nbsp;and <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i>.</p><p><b>John Peterson</b>, a longtime Chestertonian, has written seven books and numerous articles for popular and scholarly journals.</p>The quiet, inconspicuous Roman Catholic priest, Father Brown, serves souls and, on the side, solves mysteries. Flo Gibson reads twelve stories of bizarre murders and strange mysteries, which Father Brown ably solves. Gibson&#39;s unique and somewhat raspy alto voice enables her to read each of the male characters convincingly. Frequently, the characters speak with French accents, which Gibson delivers with expertise and realism. She narrates in an American-sounding English; her British accent also sounds authentic. Gibson uses a variety of emotional responses, which heighten the appeal of the stories and the enjoyment of the listener. P.A.J.

The hillside cemetery in Angel&#x2019;s Bay overlooked a restless sea, whitecaps crashing against the boulders below, dark clouds blotting out the sun. The ocean was angry, and so was she. This should have been just another Monday morning. Lucas should have been in preschool. She should have been in her own classroom, teaching French to middle-schoolers. And Derek&#x2014;Derek should not have been dead. Everything about this moment was wrong.<br> <br>Five years ago, she&#x2019;d come to Angel&#x2019;s Bay to marry Derek Kane. They&#x2019;d planned to wed by the edge of the sea. She&#x2019;d pictured the moment a thousand times. She&#x2019;d wear an off-the-shoulder white satin dress with a lacy train that went on forever. The wind would blow through her long blond hair, and the sun sparkling off the ocean would light up Derek&#x2019;s face, his hazel eyes always so beautiful and eager for her.<br> <br>But she hadn&#x2019;t married Derek on a windswept bluff. She&#x2019;d said her &#x201c;I do&#x2019;s&#x201d; in a cold, sterile room at a prison a hundred miles away, and her husband hadn&#x2019;t been wearing a tuxedo but an orange jumpsuit.<br> <br>Despite the bad start, she&#x2019;d believed that one day their lives would get back on track&#x2014;that Derek&#x2019;s innocence would be proven, his appeal would be granted. He&#x2019;d be released, and they&#x2019;d have the life they were supposed to have.<br> <br>That dream had died five weeks ago, along with Derek, leaving her with nothing but frustration, anger, and a lot of questions.<br> <br>As the minister prayed for Derek&#x2019;s soul, she glanced around the small group of mourners. They&#x2019;d waited to have the memorial service until she could pack up her apartment and move to Angel&#x2019;s Bay, where Derek&#x2019;s parents lived. Over the past month, she&#x2019;d kept herself too busy to think beyond immediate plans. Now she was here and forced to confront what she&#x2019;d been avoiding&#x2014;Derek&#x2019;s death and the end of all her dreams.<br> <br>Her mother-in-law, Nancy, a short, plump brunette, sobbed in her husband&#x2019;s arms. Her father-in-law, Rick, so tall and lean, had lost even more weight in recent weeks and was now almost gaunt as he tried to comfort his wife. Nancy&#x2019;s sister, Margaret, stood across from them, surreptitiously wiping tears from the corners of her eyes with a delicate handkerchief. Wyatt Kane, Derek&#x2019;s grandfather, stood next to her, a grim, forbidding man with fierce brown eyes and shocking white hair that was long and wild. Wyatt, an internationally acclaimed artist, had once been Derek&#x2019;s biggest supporter, but their relationship had been shattered by Derek&#x2019;s conviction. Brianna was surprised he&#x2019;d come to the funeral. He&#x2019;d certainly never visited the prison.<br> <br>Neighbors and friends of the Kanes filled out the group. Most of the mourners were of Derek&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; generation, with only a few former friends in attendance. The rest had vanished long ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mommy,&#x201d; Lucas whispered loudly as he tugged on her hand. &#x201c;How can Daddy fit in that box? Won&#x2019;t he be scared to go into the hole?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her stomach turned over at the earnest, worried question. Derek&#x2019;s ashes were enclosed in a small wooden box that would be buried in the family plot. She squatted down, putting her arm around Lucas&#x2019;s shoulders as she tried to think of an answer that wouldn&#x2019;t scare him. How did one explain death to a four-year-old?<br> <br>&#x201c;Mommy?&#x201d; Lucas&#x2019;s curious light eyes were so like his father&#x2019;s it made her heart hurt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s in heaven,&#x201d; she said gently. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s with the angels now. He&#x2019;s not scared, and you don&#x2019;t have to worry about him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then what&#x2019;s in the box?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a symbol, something to remember him by.&#x201d; She hoped the answer would be enough for him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think Daddy is looking at us right now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be watching over us wherever we go,&#x201d; she assured him.<br> <br>Lucas lifted his gaze to the sky, his eyes searching. She&#x2019;d seen the expression on his face before, and not just since Derek had died. Lucas had always been looking for his father. He&#x2019;d never understood why Derek didn&#x2019;t live with them like the other daddies did. He couldn&#x2019;t understand why his father stayed in the big ugly house with the bars.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d hoped that when Derek got out of prison, he could explain what had happened in a way that Lucas would understand and that after a while the prison years would be forgotten, replaced by happier memories. But Derek had died just before he was due to be released.<br> <br>When the minister ended his prayer, the mourners filed by, each placing a white rose on the box of ashes. The Kanes took Lucas back to the car to give Brianna a moment of privacy, but Derek&#x2019;s grandfather lingered behind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Derek was a damn fool,&#x201d; Wyatt said abruptly. &#x201c;He could have had everything, but he threw it all away for greed and ambition. He didn&#x2019;t want to work for success. He just wanted to take it.&#x201d;<br> <br>His harsh words caught her by surprise. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true. Derek was innocent. He didn&#x2019;t steal those paintings from the museum, nor did he assault the security guard. He was set up to take the fall for someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wyatt gave her a scornful look. &#x201c;If you still believe that, you&#x2019;re a damn fool. Derek was the best liar I ever met. It might have been his best talent&#x2014;his only talent. You should forget about Derek, concentrate on your son, and make sure he doesn&#x2019;t turn out like his father did.&#x201d; Wyatt tossed his rose onto the grass and left.<br> <br>Brianna drew in a shaky breath and slowly let it out, rattled by his harsh words. Her fingers began to sting, and she realized she was gripping the thorny stem of her rose. A drop of blood appeared, bright red against her pale skin, and she stared at it in fascination.<br> <br>Derek had brought her a lot of pain in recent years, but she still remembered the man she&#x2019;d fallen in love with, the one who had been outgoing, charming, and handsome, with blond hair and eyes that changed with the colors of the season. Derek had made her feel special and important, as if she were the only one who mattered. He&#x2019;d swept her off her feet with his big dreams&#x2014;the places he wanted to go, the life he wanted to lead. And that was the man she mourned now, the one with so much unrealized potential.<br> <br>Stepping forward, she laid her rose on top of the others. &#x201c;I guess this is it, Derek,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to believe you&#x2019;re really gone. We should have had more time&#x2014;a lot more time.&#x201d; She swallowed hard, a knot growing in her throat. &#x201c;But we have a beautiful son. I&#x2019;ll make sure that Lucas knows who his father was. He&#x2019;ll see where you grew up, and he&#x2019;ll walk in your memories&#x2014;at least for a while.&#x201d; Tears blurred her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to keep fighting for you, too. I won&#x2019;t stop until we get to the truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>The wind brushed against her face like the caress of a man&#x2019;s hand. She touched her fingers to her suddenly warm cheek and raised her face to the sky. There was a small break in the clouds, a whisper of blue sky . . . then the wind blew, and the dark clouds returned.<br> <br>As two men began to bury the box of ashes, she stepped back, unable to watch. She turned to move toward Nancy and Rick and caught a glimpse of a man standing just beyond the trees.<br> <br>Her heart jumped into her throat. He wasn&#x2019;t wearing a police uniform today, but she recognized him all the same&#x2014;Jason Marlow.<br> <br>He was the one who&#x2019;d built the case against Derek and sent him to jail. And he had the nerve to come to his funeral? She was halfway across the grass before she even realized she was moving. She&#x2019;d kept a tight rein on her emotions for years, but now she couldn&#x2019;t hold them in for one more second.<br> <br>Jason straightened when he saw her coming. He wore jeans and a black sweater that emphasized his broad shoulders. His hair was sandy brown, his eyes dark and wary. He stood by a dusty Jeep, and judging by his stance, the way he held his keys, he was considering making a run for it. Too late. If he didn&#x2019;t want to talk to her, he shouldn&#x2019;t have come.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell are you doing here?&#x201d; she demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came to pay my respects.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To the man you sent to prison? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t bother to fake politeness. She&#x2019;d wanted to yell at someone for a long time, and he was the perfect target.<br> <br>&#x201c;I grew up with Derek,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your friendship didn&#x2019;t matter when Derek begged you to help him. Do you really think he&#x2019;d care that you were here now, after what you did to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>Anger flashed in his eyes. &#x201c;I did my job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sent an innocent man to jail. Now he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jason swallowed hard, a battle going on in his eyes. She willed him to try to refute her statement, because she wanted a fight. She needed to release the unbearable tension in her body. Her hands clenched into fists, and it took all of her willpower not to take a swing at him. She&#x2019;d never hit anyone in her life, but damn if she didn&#x2019;t want to punch him.<br> <br>Before Jason could speak, Lucas ran over, interrupting them. He threw his little arms around her hips and gave Jason a curious look. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jason&#x2019;s face paled; her son was the mirror image of his father.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no one, Lucas,&#x201d; Brianna answered. &#x201c;Go back to the car.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Grandma Nancy says to come,&#x201d; Lucas told her. &#x201c;People are waiting at the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there. Go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucas gave Jason another look and then ran back to his grandparents.<br> <br>Jason&#x2019;s lips tightened as his gaze met hers. &#x201c;This must be rough on him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t pretend to care.&#x201d; She refused to soften at the pain in his eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re here. Did you really think you&#x2019;d be welcome?&#x201d;<br> <br>His gaze burned into hers. &#x201c;It was probably a mistake. But I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about Derek&#x2014;and about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stiffened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in what you think about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why are you still talking to me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; She turned, then glanced back at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving town. I intend to find out what really happened five years ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Derek swore he was set up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not by me,&#x201d; Jason said flatly. &#x201c;You need to let it go, Brianna.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would certainly make things easier for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And for you. Be realistic. Your private investigator couldn&#x2019;t come up with any new information because there&#x2019;s none to be found.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;No. You were wrong about Derek, and I&#x2019;ll prove it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She walked quickly back to the car, feeling Jason&#x2019;s gaze follow her every step.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was Jason doing here?&#x201d; Rick asked, concern etched across the deep lines of his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;He said he wanted to pay his respects.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe after all these years, he&#x2019;s finally sorry for not believing in Derek,&#x201d; Nancy suggested.<br> <br>Brianna watched Jason drive away. He wasn&#x2019;t sorry at all, but she would find a way to change that.<br> <br>Brianna&#x2019;s words echoed through Jason&#x2019;s head as he sped through the black iron gates of the cemetery. No way in hell had he sent an innocent man to jail, and there was no possibility that Brianna would be able to prove otherwise. Derek was guilty, and Brianna was blinded by love. He&#x2019;d thought after all this time she might have come to accept the truth about her husband, but it was clear she was still living in denial&#x2014;and in pain.<br> <br>He blew out a breath, thinking about how much she&#x2019;d changed in the past five years. Her stunning blue eyes were now haunted and weary. Her curves had thinned, and she&#x2019;d cut at least six inches off what had once been a glorious mane of thick blond hair. She wasn&#x2019;t a girl anymore but a woman, a wife, a mother . . . and a widow.<br> <br>His gut clenched with anger and sadness, not just for her and her son. Derek had once been his friend, and he missed that happy, carefree, do-anything-once guy who had died at the age of thirty-two, which was a tragedy no matter <i>what</i> he&#x2019;d done. Contrary to what Brianna thought, he&#x2019;d never wanted to send Derek to jail. He had looked hard for other suspects. There hadn&#x2019;t been any.<br> <br>In the eyes of Brianna and the Kanes, he was the enemy, the one to blame for the destruction of their family. He&#x2019;d always believed that putting the guilty behind bars was a noble cause, but even the bad guys had people who loved them.<br> <br>Too restless to go home, he headed across town to Kara and Colin&#x2019;s house. The Lynches had been his best friends since elementary school. If there were two people he could count on in life, it was them.<br> <br>As he pulled up in front of their home, he smiled at the pumpkins lining the porch rail and the cobwebs strewn across the hedges. Halloween was one of Kara and Colin&#x2019;s favorite holidays. Last year, he&#x2019;d helped Colin turn the garage into a haunted house. This year, he suspected things would be a little tamer. Colin was only five weeks into his recovery from a head injury that had left him in a coma for three months. And Kara was busy taking care of her husband and their newborn, Faith, who&#x2019;d made her arrival just a day before Colin had woken up.<br> <br>He got out of his car and was halfway to the porch steps when Kara came through the front door carrying a skeleton door decoration. She wore blue jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt, and her dark red hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She didn&#x2019;t have on a speck of makeup, but she didn&#x2019;t need any. She still had that baby glow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jason, how are you?&#x201d; she asked, setting down the skeleton to give him a big hug. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you were coming by.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your timing is perfect. Colin just got back from physical therapy, and he&#x2019;s in a bear of a mood. Maybe you can get him out of it.&#x201d; She cast a quick look back at the house to make sure they were still alone. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on with him. He&#x2019;s extremely irritable, and no matter what I do, I constantly annoy him. I wasn&#x2019;t expecting this, Jason. I thought once he woke up, he&#x2019;d be ecstatically happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Colin&#x2019;s fuse <i>did</i> seem shorter, but wasn&#x2019;t that to be expected? &#x201c;He just needs time to adjust. He&#x2019;s confused, Kara. Three months passed for us while he was frozen in time. He doesn&#x2019;t even remember being shot. Nor does he realize how close he came to dying. He expects to be able to do everything he did before, but he can&#x2019;t, and it&#x2019;s frustrating him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I need to be more patient. It&#x2019;s just not one of my strengths.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No kidding.&#x201d; He looked past Kara as the door opened and Colin stepped onto the porch, wearing navy sweatpants and a white T-shirt with the Angel&#x2019;s Bay Police Department insignia.<br> <br>Colin gave Jason a quick nod, then told Kara, &#x201c;The baby is crying. She&#x2019;s probably hungry, and I can&#x2019;t do anything about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get her. Thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Colin moved toward the porch bench, Kara gave Jason a pointed look and then disappeared into the house.<br> <br>Colin let out a sigh as he sat down and stretched his legs out in front of him. He&#x2019;d regained some color in his face the past few weeks, but his clothes still hung loosely on his big frame.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d; Jason leaned against the porch railing. &#x201c;I have to tell you that you look like shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had a workout this morning. I&#x2019;m a little tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you should take it slower.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Kara tell you to say that?&#x201d; Colin demanded, a fire in his usually calm green eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can speak for myself,&#x201d; Jason replied, unintimidated by Colin&#x2019;s bad mood. They&#x2019;d been friends since the third grade. Neither of them had siblings, and in each other they&#x2019;d found a brother. They&#x2019;d grown up together, joined the force, and worked side by side. They&#x2019;d shared good times and bad. He&#x2019;d hoped the bad was over, but it looked as if there were still some issues to work through.

Against all odds the kitten - who he names Toby Jug - survives and forms an unusually strong bond with his rescuer. Set against the rural splendour of Northumberland, &#34;Paw Tracks in the Moonlight&#34; charmingly chronicles the adventures of one man and his Maine Coone cat. From an invasion of bees at Owl Cottage to the case of the disappearing tomatoes, life with Toby Jug - who believes himself to be human - is never dull. Nevertheless, it is only when Denis and Toby Jug embark on a summer camping trip on horseback in the Cheviot Hills that a new world opens up for them both.</p><p>Denis O&#39;Connor trained as a psychologist and teacher. Throughout his career he taught in schools and lectured in colleges and universities. He holds a doctorate in education and psychology. He is retired and lives with his wife Catherine and his two Maine Coone cats in a remote country cottage in Northumberland.Paw Prints in the Moonlight <br> WINTER: THE RESCUE The icy January storm wailed through the crannies and spouts of the large old house as I stared at the scrubbed wooden table in the clinic of the vet, Scott Mackenzie. On the table lay a tragic sight. The silver-coloured she-cat was still bleeding, her flanks heaving with the desperate effort to stay alive. Next to her lay the barely living bodies of her two kittens. With immense difficulty I had rescued them and rushed them here for help. 'There'll be nothing I can be doing for any of them. They're all goners!' he said, with professional finality. His Scottish brogue was oddly comforting in that sterile, clinical atmosphere. His examination had been short but thorough. I could see expressed in the eyes of Mac the Vet the professional conclusion that saving these cats was beyond the scope and skills of modern veterinary science. 'They're past hope, laddie,' he intoned gently, perhaps fearful of my reaction. I winced at his words, not wanting to believe him as I gazed once more at the threesome lying before me on the table. Mac was right, of course, his expertise was beyond question. From appearances nothing humanely could bedone for these creatures other than a swift and painless death but I had stubbornly clung on to the hope that somehow they could be saved. In my optimism I had imagined that Mac could work a miracle and restore them to health. Then I would take the whole family home with me. I lived alone and, although I had a demanding professional life, I had long toyed with the idea of having a pet, but had never got around to acquiring one. As I looked at them again, the small hope I'd nursed started to die. They did appear to be beyond help. The she-cat was obviously too far gone to save. I imagined that her scrawny body had once been beautiful, with its silver-grey fur and elegant tail, but she was drifting helplessly in and out of consciousness as she struggled to survive. 'She'll have to be put down,' Mac said in his no-nonsense manner. 'And it would be a mercy for the kittens to go as well,' he concluded. 'They're far too young to fend for themselves even if they survive.' He left the room with the mother, intent on doing what had to be done. While he was away, I looked down at the two kittens. Both of them were male, 'Tommies' as Mac called them. One was coloured smoky blue-grey and the other was black, with minute white markings. Neither was any bigger than a shrew. Sorrowfully, I reached down to touch them, simply as a gesture of compassion. There was no warmth nor any other sign of life in the grey kitten's bodybut when my fingers stroked the black-and-white kitten he stirred ever so slightly and I thought I heard a faint sigh. Suddenly, the kitten moved, curling its tiny body as if to cuddle up to the warmth of my hand. Startled, I looked down again at this little waif. It had certainly moved but I didn't know whether this was because it was in the throes of death or not. I found myself becoming very angry. 'Cats are very special creatures. It's grossly unfair that things like this should be allowed to happen,' I said to myself, overcome by the strength of my feelings. I recalled long-forgotten incidents and experiences that years spent as a city-dweller had all but obliterated. The simple reaction of the kitten to the warmth of my hand revived a memory of myself as a small boy who naively believed that his love for animals, birds, flowers and trees would somehow serve to protect them. I'd thought that by cherishing 'Nature' in all its forms I could conserve it. I had not thought about such things for many years but, lately, these childhood feelings had started to resurface, inspired no doubt by my rural surroundings. Images from the past flooded my mind as, with my finger and thumb, I gently stroked the body of the black kitten and waited for the vet to return. Best remembered were the days of my childhood spent in the woods and fields by the River Derwent and at the lake at Axwell ParkEstate where I was born. Out of nowhere came the memory of the hurt I felt when I fell out with my best friend, Billy Morrison, as we explored Winlaton Woods because he wanted to take some eggs from a blue-tit's nest we'd found in a hollowed oak tree and I wouldn't let him. I also recalled the shock one Sunday morning of finding a mallard duck flapping about in the meadow grass with half her wing shot away by the irresponsible hunters out for a morning's 'sport'. Like the poet Wordsworth, I had always loved nature and now, at twenty-nine years of age, living a bachelor existence and working in a country market town, these feelings were crystallizing into what was becoming a devotion to the wild creatures and landscapes of Northumberland. It was 1966 and I had been given the opportunity to work as a lecturer in Educational Studies at Alnwick College of Education in Northumberland. Consequently, I had bought Owl Cottage, an eighteenth-century stone building which stood on a hillside above the River Coquet, with uninterrupted views across the village of Felton towards the distant Cheviot Hills. This was to be a new beginning, the fulfilment of a dream. In the past cats had always been a part of my life and the households of my childhood and youth were never without at least one cat. I loved them all, not least for their dignified and independent natures. Every one of them had been a friend and playmate and every one of themwas special. Cats have always fascinated me because they are so mysterious and difficult to analyse in spite of their domesticity. I knew that cats probably first became domesticated in Ancient Egypt, about 15,000 years ago. For a time cats were even adored as representatives of gods, and their images were sculpted in precious metals encrusted with jewels. Once, on a working trip to Trinity College, Dublin, I was intrigued to find an illustration of a cat in the historic <i>Book of Kells</i>, the illuminated manuscript made by the monks on the island of Iona in the eighth or ninth century. Fascinated by this reference I bought a replica bronze statuette of the cat. On the back of the statuette I found the following inscription: 'Cats are both homely and mysterious. They walk silently, mate noisily, they rid us of pests. Their eyes shine in the dark and their pupils change as the moon, from round to crescent. They are sacred to the Moon-goddess and familiars of the feminine.' For me, cats have always been more than just domesticated animals. They have the 'Call of the Wild', which makes them forsake the comfort of their home from time to time to prowl and hunt, preferably in the fields and woods, but also in our gardens, streets and parks. These characteristics fascinate people across the world to the extent that, for many, keeping cats as pets becomes an addiction. With these thoughts and sentiments running through myhead I suddenly felt an urge, almost an obligation, to do something even if it seemed reckless as well as hopeless. At this point Mac, having don*e his deed of mercy with the grey tabby, returned to deal similarly with the two kittens. On a sudden impulse, and to Mac's utter consternation, I scooped up the black-and-white kitten from the table and deposited him carefully into the pocket of my sheepskin jacket. 'You're a sentimental fool,' he said sternly, shocked by my action. 'The wee thing will suffer and die no matter what you do.' 'Well,' I replied, 'he might just as well die in front of my fire as anywhere else. Please send me the bill.' With these hurried words of farewell I left an incredulous Mac shaking his head. His words rang in my ears. 'Sentimental fool,' he'd said. How well I recalled the many times those words had been directed towards me, even by my own father, because of my passionate feelings for wildlife. Struggling with these emotions, I drove slowly home on the snow-packed roads and reflected on the harrowing events of the day. &nbsp; <br> The trip to the vet had followed what began as a normal, dull, grey January day. As I arrived home from work and got out of the car, I felt a heaviness in the air. Living in the country away from the enclosed life of the city had made me far more aware of changes in the weather. By noting howthe sky looked, the direction and strength of the wind, as well as the behaviour of birds and animals, my more experienced eye could forecast fairly accurately if any major changes in the weather were on the way. 'It will snow tonight,' a neighbour remarked as he walked his dog along the footpath past my drive. 'Looks like a storm's coming,' I called back. He smiled and nodded in reply as he was tugged along by Butch, his massive black Labrador. Later, when it did snow, it was heavier than either of us expected. After closing the garage doors I paused by the tall cypress tree to watch the flocks of crows wheeling noisily over their rookery, having returned from marauding the local fields. I loved to watch the sky at this time of day when the soft gentle light of evening slowly gave way to darkness. Sometimes there would be such a subtle toning of colours that the landscape looked like a Turner painting. Alone in my garden at such a moment I could indulge the thought that this was a private viewing for my eyes only. On other days, the colours of sunset would be so boldly red, orange and yellow that they mesmerized me with their beauty. I often reflected that I never had enough time just to watch and appreciate the sky. Tonight, though, there was no sunset - only overcast clouds that gave off a half-light. As I dawdled, the air all around grew still and became electric. I stood spellbound, aware that something eventfulwas about to happen. Then it began to grow darker and I felt a sudden chill. Snow started to fall silently, driving the chaffinches and blackbirds from the bird-table to seek sanctuary in the hedges that fringed the wood at the end of my garden. Despite the cold, I stayed there for a few more moments, witnessing the first snowfall of winter. Suddenly, the tranquil scene changed dramatically and I was nearly swept off my feet by sudden gusts of wind that turned the shower into a blizzard. Covered in huge flakes of snow and numbed with cold, I hastily made for the patio door of the cottage. Once inside, I felt besieged by the storm which was growing stronger by the minute. It rattled the back door and covered the window panes with pale shutters of snow. I shed my overcoat, brushing it free of snowflakes, and hung it to dry in the narrow hall. The sounds of the gale outside grew wilder but this only added to my feelings of safety and comfort inside the cottage. It was Friday and the weekend beckoned with its promise of rest and recreation. Icy draughts from the doors and windows swept around me but failed to dampen my good spirits as I put a match to the log fire and lit the candles around the sitting room. After a hot meal of grilled steak and fried potatoes, I settled down by the fireside with a book and a glass of wine for an evening of homely bliss. I was as yet unaware of the coming turn of events that would shatter my relaxation and change my life for many years to come. The mellow chimes of the French clock striking seven awoke me from an armchair snooze. By this time the storm had moved on and I became aware of an all-pervading stillness. The fire had burned down to roasting hot embers that warmed me right through to my toes and my armchair was, at that moment, the most comfortable place in the whole world. But the particular quiet that comes after a storm is alluring and I couldn't resist the temptation to look outside and sample the night air. The view from my back doorway was bleak but breathtaking. The windblown snow had transformed the familiar scene into a wilderness of pure white. It felt bitterly cold and the air tasted dry and frosted like chilled wine. The sky had cleared and a full moon shone starkly down from a black background of shimmering stars unlike anything I ever saw in the polluted skies of the cities where I had lived for so many years. It thrilled me to imagine again that perhaps I was a solitary witness to this splendour. As far as I could see from my back door, none of my neighbours were sharing the beauty of this night. It was a Christmas-card scene so captivating that it held me there until I realized I was slowly beginning to freeze. I moved to return indoors. Suddenly, the silence was pierced by the scream of an animal. It was a strident cry of pain, totally shattering the stillness that had followed the heavy snowfall. It was frightening and terrible to hear and in the midst of all the beautyaround me it seemed so unreal. I felt as if every sense in my body was switched to full alert. Shocked and alarmed, I strained to find out where it came from. Then I heard it again, a howl full of agony and distress. It sounded close by but I could see nothing. It came again and yet again. This time I thought I knew roughly the location it was coming from. Moving out to get a better view I found myself having to wade through powdery snowdrifts, slipping and sliding in my haste. In spite of shivering in the intense cold I pressed on without a thought for my inadequate clothing. I didn't have a coat on and I was only wearing my carpet slippers. Eventually, I reached the outskirts of the wood that led to Blackbrook Farm. Something squirmed in the snow ahead and wailed with the torment of moving. A silver-grey cat lay twisting and turning in a gin-trap which held it fast by the hind leg. As I approached, the cat's struggles to escape became frenzied and I saw that the snow around it was heavily bloodstained. Shocked and distressed by the sight, I had to find a way to release it, but that proved far from easy. Demented by its injuries and panicked by my presence, it hindered my well-intentioned efforts with a fit of spitting and clawing. Scrambling about on my hands and knees in the snow, I eventually succeeded in prising open the jaws of the rusty trap which had bitten deeply into its leg. To my surprise, despite its severe wounds, the cat took off at highspeed through the snow and was quickly gone from sight. Breathless with exertion and badly scratched and bitten about the hands and arms, I struggled to find a footing on the frozen ground but managed to raise myself up. Still reeling from the shock of this sudden and unexpected experience, at first I didn't know what I should do, if anything. Where had the cat gone? Had it simply headed for the nearest cover? Was it now lying under some fir tree, racked with pain? Cold and wet, I decided to return to the cottage for comfort and medication, as well as time to think. A welcome glass of brandy, some first aid and a roasting in front of the revived log fire did much to restore my spirits. As I thawed out I reviewed the situation. Thinking about what I had seen started to vex me. It was worrying to think about the injured cat and how desperately it needed help. 'I can't just leave things like that,' I said to myself aloud, but it wasn't really any business of mine. Perhaps I should leave it alone. After all, it was getting late and I was tired. Also, it wasn't the weather to go tramping around looking for an injured animal and either a fox or farm dog would most probably have got to it already. Even if the cat survived until daylight, the carrion crows, nature's scavengers, would soon dispatch it and that would be the end of it. Still, I had spent a childhood living with cats and I had a great fondness for them.

She was the author of The Stones of Florence and Birds of America, among other books.For three decades, Mary McCarthy (1912-89), the American novelist and literary critic, and Hannah Arendt (1906-75), the German-born American philosopher and political scientist, shared a rare and enviable friendship that spanned the continents. Their long correspondence is fascinating in its revelation of two very different personalities and their views on notable political, philosophical, and literary figures and events of the day, such as Karl Jaspers, Robert Lowell, the Vietnam War, the trial of Adolf Eichmann, Richard Nixon, and Watergate. The two intellectuals share professional and personal concerns and critique each other's works. The collection is uneven, with more letters from McCarthy than Arendt. Contextual notes are placed at the beginning of the correspondence or at the end, with the exception of explanatory terms found in brackets within the letters, a practice that is both helpful and distracting.

During the 16th and 17th centuries they developed into attractively illustrated printed books, the forerunners of modern botanical and pharmaceutical textbooks. Agnes Arber&#39;s Herbals (first published in 1912, much revised in 1938) stands as the major survey of the period 1470 to 1670 when botany evolved into a scientific discipline separate from herbalism, a development reflected in contemporary herbals. Every work on herbals since 1912 has been indebted to Arber&#39;s classic. The present volume in the Cambridge Science Classics series, while retaining her main text unaltered, supplements this with two of her later writings on herbals, provides a biographical introduction, greatly extends the bibliography and has annotations modifying the original text through later enquiry.

Adopting those aspects of the religion that suited his purposes, he turned Rome on a course from the relatively open, tolerant and pluralistic civilization of the Hellenistic world, towards a culture that was based on the rule of fixed authority, whether that of the Bible, or the writings of Ptolemy in astronomy and of Galen and Hippocrates in medicine. Only a thousand years later, with the advent of the Renaissance and the emergence of modern science, did Europe begin to free itself from the effects of Constantine's decision, yet the effects of his establishment of Christianity as a state religion remain with us, in many respects, today. Brilliantly wide-ranging and ambitious, this is a major work of history.</p><p>Charles Freeman is the author of <i>The Greek Achievement </i>(1999) and <i>Egypt, Greece, Rome</i> (1997).1<br>Thomas Aquinas and "the triumph of faith"<br><br>A monk in the black-and-white habit of the Dominicans sits in a niche set within an elaborate columned edifice crowned by a vault. Carved on the panels either side of him are fasces, rods bound together, a symbol of authority that reaches back through the history of ancient Rome to the Etruscans. Conventionally, as those who are attuned to the more sinister aspects of modern European history will be all too well aware, an axe is fixed within the bundle, but here it is omitted and the fasces are lit. Even in ancient times the presence of the axe was associated with tyrannical authority, so the omission suggests a deliberate attempt to evoke an authority that is benign rather than menacing. A setting in Rome is confirmed by the views behind the imposing structure. On one side there is part of St. John Lateran, the cathedral church of Rome, fronted by an equestrian statue believed in the 1480s, the date of this fresco, to be of the emperor Constantine, its founder. On the other is the Porta Ripa Grande, the port alongside the river Tiber in Rome. The fresco itself is in the Carafa Chapel in Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, a Dominican church in the city. Even if the fasces are not menacing, one aspect of the fresco nevertheless is. The monk crushes a scowling old man beneath his feet. The old man is a personification of evil, and he clutches a banner with the Latin inscription "Wisdom conquers evil." The monk himself is none other than the great Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-74). Above him in a roundel are the verses from the Book of Proverbs with which he chose to begin one of his finest works, the Summa contra gentiles, "a summary of the case against the heretics": "For my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips." Also above him, on panels held by putti, appears a declaration of the importance of the revealed word of God: "The revelation of Thy words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple." The most important text, however, must be that which Thomas has selected to hold in his left hand; it is from the Apostle Paul, sapientiam sapientum perdam, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise." As this book will suggest, the phrase, supported by other texts of Paul which condemn the "empty logic of the philosophers," was the opening shot in the enduring war between Christianity and science.<br><br>Here Thomas is in a position of authority, defending the revelatory power of God against "the wisdom of the wise." Yet this "wisdom" is allowed some place. Alongside the saint sit four further personifications, in order from the left, those of Philosophy, Theology, Grammar and Dialectic. Philosophy (largely the study of formal logic), grammar and dialectic (the art of disputation) were the first subjects of the traditional medieval curriculum. However, though they may appear at ease alongside Thomas, they are clearly subordinate to the word of God, as preliminaries that had to be mastered before any advanced study in theology, the longest and most challenging course, could begin. Theology's prominence over the others is shown here by her crown and her hand raised to heaven, as well as by her position immediately to the right of Thomas.<br><br>Below Thomas and his intellectual companions two groups of men stand back from a clutter of books and manuscripts. A debate has been in progress, and it seems that its settlement has resulted in a disposal of discarded arguments. The reference here is to the fourth and fifth centuries, when the empire, newly if not fully Christianized, was rocked with debate over the nature of Jesus and his relationship with God. The Arians (followers of Arius) claimed that Jesus was a distinct and lower creation, divine perhaps but not fully God. At the opposite extreme, the followers of Sabellius, a Roman cleric, claimed that the Godhead was one and Jesus on earth was only a temporary manifestation of that Godhead, in no way distinct from it. In the fresco Arius stands on the left, a serious and thoughtful man as tradition records, wearing yellow robes. In front of him a book bearing the words of his thesis, "There was a time when the Son was not," lies condemned. Sabellius, shown as an austere Roman in a red robe, gazes down on his work with its own heretical assertion, that the Father is not to be distinguished from the Son, likewise condemned. Other heretics, including the Persian Mani (to the right of Sabellius in a furred hood), to whose sect St. Augustine belonged before his conversion to Christianity, are in the crowd. These heretics had all been subject to specific refutation by Thomas in his works. What Thomas now upholds is the final solution to the issue, the doctrine of the Trinity. God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit have distinct personalities within a single Godhead. It is a doctrine, as Thomas himself wrote in his other great work, the Summa theologiae, that cannot be upheld by reason, but only through faith.<br><br>The "triumph of faith," as depicted here by the Florentine painter Filippino Lippi, reflects the theme of this book. "Faith" is a complex concept, but whether it is trust in what cannot be seen, belief in promises made by God, essentially a declaration of loyalty or a virtue, it involves some kind of acquiescence in what cannot be proved by rational thought. What makes faith a difficult concept to explore is that it has both theological and psychological elements. At a psychological level one could argue that faith must exist in any healthy mind. If we cannot trust anyone, have any optimism that "all will be well," we cannot live full lives. Such faith will include positive responses to individuals, as evinced by those who met and travelled with Jesus. Here we cross a conceptual boundary because faith in Jesus, and in particular in the saving nature of his crucifixion and resurrection as taught by Paul, was of a different order from faith in the general sense that "all will be well." With the elaboration of Christian doctrine, faith came to mean acquiescence in the teachings of the churches-to be seen as a virtue in itself.<br><br>In the fourth and fifth centuries a.d., however, faith in this last sense achieved prominence over reason. The principles of empirical observation or logic were overruled in the conviction that all knowledge comes from God and even, in the writings of Augustine, that the human mind, burdened with Adam's original sin, is incapable of thinking for itself. For centuries any form of independent scientific thinking was suppressed. Yet, and this is the paradox of the Carafa fresco, it was actually Thomas, through reviving the works of Aristotle, who brought reason back into theology and hence into western thought. Once again it was possible for rational thought and faith to co-exist. We will meet the other Thomas, the Thomas who champions reason alongside faith, in the final chapter of this book.<br><br>We begin by returning to ancient Greece and exploring in particular how reason became established as an intellectual force in western culture. Then we can see how Christianity, under the influential banner of Paul's denunciation of Greek philosophy, began to create the barrier between science-and rational thought in general-and religion that appears to be unique to Christianity. Far from the rise of science challenging the Christian concept of God (as is often assumed by protagonists in the debate), it was Christianity that actively challenged a well-established and sophisticated tradition of scientific thinking.<br><br>2<br>The quest for certainty<br>The investigation of the truth is in one way hard, in another easy. An indication of this is found in the fact that no one is able to attain the truth adequately, while, on the other hand, no one fails entirely, but everyone says something true about the nature of things, and while individually they contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable amount is amassed.<br><br>Aristotle<br><br>On his long journey home from Troy to his wife, Penelope, in Ithaca, Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, was swept from his ship through the fury of Poseidon, the god of earthquakes and the sea, who had turned against him. Luckily, the goddess Leukothea, who lived in the depths of the sea, took pity on him and offered him a magic scarf that, when bound around him, would protect him, while the goddess Athena calmed the waves so that he could swim towards the shores of the land of the Phaeacians. In this crisis Odysseus still had to make his own decisions, in the short term at what moment he should leave the timbers of his ship and strike for shore. A massive wave sent by Poseidon made the decision for him, and he found himself swimming without any support. The coast came into view, but it was rugged. Is it better, Odysseus wondered, to land where he can and risk being crushed against the cliffs by a wave, or continue onwards in his exhaustion in the hopes of finding a sandy bay?<br><br>Odysseus' ordeal ended happily. He was washed ashore and rescued by the beautiful Nausicaa, daughter of the Phaeacian king. He was saved by two goddesses who successfully challenged another god, Poseidon. So here is a man at the mercy of divine forces who nevertheless retained the power to think rationally and who saw rational thought as a means of bettering his chances. One can hardly say this is a revolutionary step; archaeological evidence from South African caves shows that individuals were able to provide "rational" adaptations to their changing environment (in the sense of adapting their tools) as long as 70,000 years ago. What is important is that Homer distinguishes rational thought, even at this primitive, almost instinctive level, as a mental activity, independent of the whim of the gods.<br><br>This is the mental landscape of Greece in the eighth century or earlier-the Odyssey took its final form about 725 b.c. from much older oral traditions-but it is a world that is...</p><h2>From Dawn till Dusk</h2><p>Filled with stunning woodcut illustrations, a fascinating picture book captures life on the farm throughout the year, from chores such as chopping wood in the fall and weeding in the summer, to fun activities such as night-swimming in the pond in the summer and skiing off the barn roof in the winter.</p><p>Natalie Kinsey-Warnock considers her childhood one of the best imaginable.

She lives, skis, and gardens in Vermont.</p>Grade 1-3-"My brothers and sister and I grew up on a farm of steep, wooded hills and fields with rocks as big as your head." During the long Vermont winter, the young narrator and her brothers argue about moving away when they grow up. The discussion begins during a gathering around the wood stove and ranges over days and nights and through the seasons as the girl recounts things they all do during the year, some that they might miss, and some that they'd be glad to leave behind. Maple sugaring numbs the hands and feet with bone-chilling cold, but they all love the taste of the maple candy and their aunt's doughnuts. The muddy spring followed by fence building and clearing stones from the field, hot days of haying and evenings of fishing for supper, the planting of vegetables and the harvest, and skiing right off the barn roof all unfold in the spare narrative and hand-tinted woodcuts. Azarian uses both facing scenes and full-spread views to create a fine sense of people and place. The cheerful view of family and farm comes round to the Christmas pageant at church, and a final page reveals where the siblings and cousins live as adults. It's all a bit nostalgic but the story will surely strike a familiar chord in many families, and it should be eye-opening to readers for whom life on a farm is quite different from their own experiences.<br><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Creative Conspiracy: The New Rules of Breakthrough Collaboration</h2><p><b>Embracing the Counterintuitive Side of Collaboration</b><br><br>Think of your to-do list at work.

It appears at a most timely juncture, as the bloody and protracted struggle seems at last to be headed for resolution.<br><br>With great clarity of vision, Professor Morris finds the roots of this conflict in the deep religious, ethnic, and political differences between the Zionist immigrants and the native Arab population of Palestine. He describes the gradual influx of Jewish settlers, which was eventually fiercely resisted by the Arabs during the decades of&nbsp;&nbsp;British Mandatory government following World War I. <br><br>The establishment of the State of Israel in 1947 - 48 gave the Jews a homeland in the wake of the Holocaust, but the ensuing flight of the Palestinian Arabs shattered their society and led to the birth of a festering refugee problem. Morris describes these epic events and the Arab onslaught that followed, as he does each of the subsequent wars (in 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982 - 85); the Intifada of 1987 - 91, when the Palestinian populace of the West Bank and Gaza Strip rebelled against Israeli rule; and the rise of fundamentalist religious movements on both sides of the barricades. Tracing the successes and failures of politicians, generals, and diplomats in both camps, he regards their actions and plight with accuracy and empathy, drawing on archival materials, memoirs, and secondary works to give a vivid account of each major military encounter--and of the vicissitudes of peace efforts from the post-1948 negotiations through the Camp David (1977 - 79), Oslo (1993 - 95), and Wye River Plantation (1998) accords. Mr. Morris offers sharply etched portraits and illuminating anecdotes about the charismatic leaders who have been the chief protagonists of this contentious history, including Theodor Herzl, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, David Ben-Gurion, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin, to name only a few. <br><br><b>Righteous Victims</b> ends with Mr. Morris's analysis of the current state of play, when the election of Ehud Barak as prime minister (May 1999) has opened the door to a renewal of negotiations between Israel and its Palestinian and Syrian neighbors. As the denizens of the Middle East set out to write the next chapter in this long and difficult struggle, <b>Righteous Victims</b> is essential reading: a monumental work of narration and explication for all who seek to understand the history of the conflict and the prospects for peace.</p><p>Making sense of any particular episode in the long and convoluted conflict between Arabs and Israelis can seem a Sisyphean task--engineering peace in the Middle East has become nearly clich�d in its complexity, with each individual dispute traceable back to years of anger, mistrust, and mutual misunderstanding fueled by cycles of violence and revenge. To add to this confusion, the historical record has been colored by "emphatic partisanship by commentators and historians from both sides, as well as by foreign observers," adds Middle East historian Benny Morris. So what Morris has undertaken in this volume--an inclusive, dispassionate, and rigorous history of the conflict, from Zionism's birth in the wake of the Russian pogroms through to the uncertain prospects for peace in 1999--is no mean feat.<p> A calm, balanced voice (although a controversial one among some who fear revisionism), Morris has previously proven his scholarship with such definitive titles as <i>Israel's Border Wars</i> and <i>The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem</i>. <i>Righteous Victims</i> likewise doesn't waver in its task, methodically unearthing the political and military roots of the struggle, from early friction between Zionist "colonizers" and native Arabs slowly through to the establishment of Israel and the bloody wars and terrorism that followed. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>&#x201c;The most sophisticated and nuanced account of the Zionist-Arab conflict.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;A very rich account....

Kathryn Telman, "a senior executive officer, third level (counting from the top) in a commercial organization which has had many different names through the ages but which, these days, we usually just refer to as the Business," has been selected to negotiate the Business's purchase of the sovereign state of Thulahn (where "the royal palace is heated by yak dung" and the "national sport is emigration"). Corporate takeovers are small potatoes compared to the acquisition of an entire country, and Kathryn's politely scheming superiors have set their sights on a seat at the United Nations and the "unrestricted use of that perfect smuggling route called the diplomatic bag." </p><p> Kathryn's voice, at once polished and gritty, is the novel's strongest point. Her wry dissections of the Business, its motives and ambitions, its members, and the delightful irony of negotiating with Thulahn's crown prince (who is more interested in matrimony than marketeering) are sheer reading pleasure. And the notion of an ancient, omnipotent, secretive corporation is a great starting point for any number of stories. But <i>The Business</i> is, sadly, next to bankrupt on the level of plot. Of the two storylines that structure the novel (the takeover of Thulahn and Kathryn's growing suspicion of high-level fraud), neither amounts to much. Their development and resolution, such as they are, seem so haphazard that the reader might wonder whether Banks just lost interest in his own story. </p><p> For dedicated Banks fans, <i>The Business</i> may not be on a par with his other outings, but the pleasure of his prose is nonetheless satisfying. Newcomers to the Banks mystique, having no points of reference, may be well content with his arch humor and forceful characterization. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984.

The sixth installment in the series, Lawton&#x2019;s novel opens in 1938 with Europe on the brink of war. In London, Frederick Troy, newly promoted to the prestigious Murder Squad at Scotland Yard, is put in charge of rounding up a list of German and Italian enemy aliens&#x201d; that also includes Frederick&#x2019;s brother, Rod, who learns upon receiving an internment letter that despite having grown up in England he is Austrian-born. Hundreds of men are herded by train to a neglected camp on the Isle of Man. And, as the bombs start falling on London, a murdered rabbi is found, then another, and another. Amidst great war, murder is what matters. Moving from the Nazi-infested alleys of pre-war Vienna to the bombed out streets of 1940 London, and featuring an extraordinary cast of characters, Lawton&#x2019;s latest brings to life war-torn London. In this uncommon thriller, John Lawton delivers a suspenseful and intelligent novel, as a good a spy story as it is an historical narrative.</p><p>John Lawton worked for Channel 4 for many years, and, among many others, produced Harold Pinter&#39;s &#39;O Superman&#39;, the least-watched most-argued-over programme of the 90s. He has written seven novels in his Troy series, two Joe Wilderness novels, the standalone Sweet Sunday, a couple of short stories and the occasional essay. He writes very slowly and almost entirely on the hoof in the USA or Italy, but professes to be a resident of a tiny village in the Derbyshire Peak District. He admires the work of Barbara Gowdy, TC Boyle, Oliver Bleeck, Franz Schubert and Clara Schumann - and is passionate about the playing of Maria Joao Pires. He has no known hobbies, belongs to no organisations and hates being photographed.Lawton's engrossing sixth entry but the first chronologically in his Inspector Troy thriller series (<i>Black Out</i>, etc.) chronicles the major events leading up to WWII--Germany's annexation of Austria, Chamberlain's peace efforts, <i>Kristallnacht</i>--while providing a disturbing picture of anti-Semitism and class frictions in England at the time. As part of Scotland Yard's murder squad, Insp. Frederick Troy investigates a series of slayings of London rabbis, but various subplots equally intrigue, notably one that unfolds in an internment camp for Germans, Jews and foreigners--including Troy's Austrian-born brother, Rod--rounded up after Britain's entry into the war. At one point, Troy and a lady friend discover the "aphrodisia of war" in Hyde Park, a spot popular with couples for copulation during the blitz. Lawton does a fine job of incorporating such lesser known period details into his saga, though some readers may find he relies too often on deus ex machina for their taste. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

HOWARD is a game designer who notably co-scripted the first three <i>Broken Sword</i> adventure games. He is the author of the novel <i>Johannes Cabal the Necromancer</i>. He lives near Bristol, England, with his wife and daughter.Chapter 1:&nbsp;In which death awaits and a plot is hatched&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condemned cell stank of cats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no rats and no cockroaches, for which Johannes Cabal--a necromancer of some little infamy--was grateful. But the cost of vermin control was an army of cats who crept in and out of his cell and wandered throughout the dungeons of the HarslausCastle with complete impunity. Even the cell doors had cat flaps cut into them. It was no secret that the warders had a much higher opinion of the animals than they did of the inmates. When Cabal was given his introductory tour--which took the form of beingthrown down the stairs and shouted at--he had been left in no doubt that any harm that he might cause the cats would be returned to him, plus interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now he sat and waited for the authorities to find a window in their very busy schedules to execute him, and he did so covered in cat hair in a cell that countless generations of toms had proudly and extravagantly claimed as their own. Things could probablybe worse but, despite some careful thought, Cabal couldn't put his finger on how. So, instead, he considered how he had come to be in such a circumstance. Strictly, necromancy was the telling of the future by summoning up the spirits of the dead and askingthem searching questions. This, Cabal believed, was a singularly poor way of finding out anything. The dead were moderately strong on history, weak on current events, and entirely useless for discerning what was to come. They were, after all, dead. Still, thatwas the dictionary definition of necromancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, however, it became apparent that necromancy, necromancer, and necromantic were fine words wasted on useless definitions, and the lexicological group consciousness gently slid them over a few notches so that they now pertained to somethinginteresting--i.e., magic involving the dead. This was far more satisfying: summoning up the ghost of Aunt Matilda for an insight into next week's lottery numbers was dull; a maniac with a pointy beard unleashing an army of skeletal warriors, however, was fun.Thus, we see the evolution of a language--and a gratifying sight it is, to be sure. Johannes Cabal had no time for the Aunt Matildas of this world or the next. He fitted neatly into the newer definition of necromancer--he dealt with raising the dead (althoughskeletal warriors he left to those of a more theatrical bent). First and foremost, he considered himself a scientist embarked upon a search for a cure for a terrible disease. Death. This would seem laudable if it were not for his methods, his manner, and hisfailed experiments, the latter tending to hang around the countryside, dismaying the yokels. Even this might have been forgivable--pharmaceutical companies have done worse--if it were not for the bad reputation that the more melodramatic necromancers have giventhe profession. Skeletal warriors are all very well when they're chasing Jason and the Argonauts around on the silver screen, but when they're battering down your door . . . Well, that's a different matter altogether. So the necromancers were all besmirchedwith the same gory brush, and Cabal, who just wanted to be left to his research, found himself in a profession proscribed in the most capital terms. It was very galling. Especially when you got caught.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cabal had been caught trying to check out a book from the library of the Krenz University. The book was in the Special Collection, and Cabal had intended the loan to be of an extended, open-ended sort of period. Anticipating resistance from the libraryauthorities, he had made the loan at half past one in the morning of a national holiday and might have got away with it, too, if it hadn't been for an enormous mastiff that patrolled the corridors and of which his contacts had unaccountably failed to warn him.When the library was reopened, they'd found Cabal pinned down by 180 pounds of overfriendly dog in the reading room, half drowned in slobber. Just out of reach was a well-travelled Gladstone bag that was found to contain an enormous handgun, a collection ofsurgical instruments, a closely written notebook, a padded case holding several sealed test tubes full of murky fluids, and the library's own demy-quarto copy of Principia Necromantica.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wanted a long, drawn-out trial. In fact, nobody who mattered wanted a trial at all, so Johannes Cabal didn't get one. He was just told that he was going to be executed and taken to Harslaus Castle. That had all been almost a month ago, and Cabalwas getting bored. He knew full well that his execution was unlikely to be any more formal than his sentencing and at any time, probably in the wee small hours, the door would thud open, he'd be manhandled off to some dark cellar, his throat would be cut, andhis twitching cadaver thrown down an oubliette. But there was nothing he could do about it, so why worry? Still, it hadn't happened yet; they were still feeding him with nearly edible food, and the more intelligent cats had long since learned to stay out ofhis cell. So why were they waiting? He had a vague and uncomfortable feeling that somebody somewhere had plans for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it happened just as he'd expected after all, in the wee small hours of the morning. He was awoken by the sound of the cell door being thrown open and, before he could recover his wits, a sack was pulled over his head and he was bundled off down thelabyrinthine corridors. He didn't try to fight; there were at least four of them, of whom even the slightest might be described as "burly." He could only stay calm, wait for any small opportunity to escape, should one arise, and hope that, if all failed, andhe was to die, the entry procedures for Hell had at least been rationalised since his last visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was half dragged, half carried for a short time and then thrown into a chair. The sack was whipped off him and, as he blinked in the hard light, he caught a glimpse of a dour, portly man stropping a cutthroat razor on a leather strap. He had the presenceof mind to be impressed that such clandestine executions were so common that they seemed to have somebody employed to commit them. This sangfroid slipped slightly when brutal hands stripped him of his stinking clothes. Any complaints he might have wished tomake thus provoked were drowned when he was thrown into a tub of soapy water and belaboured with sponges. He was still coughing bubbles when he was dragged out again, held down in the chair, slapped in the face with a quantity of lather, and the portly man--gloweringfiercely--grabbed him by the throat and slashed at him with the razor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cabal stopped struggling immediately. The man slid his eyes sideways to look at the quantity of bristles and soap scum that hung from the blade. He twitched the razor and the scum flew in a discrete body off into the shadows, where it fell with an indistinctplap. His eyes swivelled back to regard Cabal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warm for the time of year, isn't it, sir?" he grated. The razor swept in again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, Cabal--cleanly shaven, bathed, and dressed in freshly pressed clothes--regarded himself in the mirror. He stood a shade over six feet tall and, although he'd have preferred his blond hair cut back a little and the suit they'd given himwas a dark grey rather than his habitual black, he wasn't altogether displeased with his appearance. It was sober, and Cabal was a very sober man. "Not bad," he said, running his hand over his chin. "Not bad at all. You're the prison barber, then?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, sir," said the man as he put his razor and strap away. "I'm the executioner. But it pays to have more than one feather in me cap. Good morning."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal watched him leave with mixed feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feeling more human, Herr Cabal?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabal turned his head to look at the newcomer and instantly suspected that he'd been there the whole time, in the shadows. An educated voice. Cabal sighed inwardly--this was probably going to become political, and politics and politicians bored him immeasurably."No more than usual," he replied. "I gather I am to be released?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You gather incorrectly," said the newcomer, stepping into the light. He was in his late thirties, slim, moustachioed, and beautifully turned out in the uniform of a captain of the Imperial Hussars, the jacket over his shoulders, the busby tucked underhis arm. His bearing and the order hanging at his throat loudly proclaimed "landed aristocracy." He walked to the table upon which Cabal's old clothes lay, swept them to the floor, and perched on the corner. He produced a cigarette case, took one for himself,and then offered the case to Cabal. "Do you smoke, Herr Cabal?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only to be antisocial," replied Cabal, making no move.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hussar smiled, put the case away, and lit his own cigarette.

Cabal had raised a finger of query.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps it's just me being a stickler for nomenclature, but doesn't the title of 'emperor' presuppose some sort of empire?

This book is less a thriller than a character study of the main characters: Judy Hammer, chief of police in Charlotte, North Carolina; Hammer's deputy, Virginia West; and Andy Brazil, a young reporter assigned to ride with the police as they go about their jobs.</p><p><b>Patricia Cornwell</b>&nbsp;is considered one of the world's bestselling crime writers. Her intrepid medical examiner Kay Scarpetta first appeared on the scene in 1990 with&nbsp;<i>Postmortem</i>&#x2014;the only novel to win the Edgar, Creasey, Anthony, and Macavity awards and the French Prix du Roman d'Aventure in a single year&#x2014;and&nbsp;<i>Cruel and Unusual</i>, which won Britain's prestigious Gold Dagger Award for the best crime novel of 1993. Dr. Kay Scarpetta herself won the 1999 Sherlock Award for the best detective created by an American author. Ms. Cornwell's work is translated into 36 languages across more than 120 countries.Chapter One <p>That morning, summer sulked and gathered darkly over Charlotte, and heat shimmered on pavement. Traffic teemed, people pushing forward to promise as they drove through new construction, and the past was bulldozed away. The USBank Corporate Center soared sixty stories above downtown, topped by a crown that looked like organ pipes playing a hymn to the god of money. This was a city of ambition and change. It had grown so fast, it could not always find its own streets. Like a boy in puberty, it was rapidly unfolding and clumsy at times, and a little too full of what its original settlers had called pride. </p><p>The city and its county were named for Princess Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz before she became George III's queen. The Germans, who wanted the same freedoms the Scotch-Irish did, were one thing, The English were another. When Lord Cornwallis decided to come to town in 1780 and occupied what became known as the Queen City, he was met with such hostility by these stubborn Presbyterians that he dubbed Charlotte "the hornet's nest of America." Two centuries later, the swarming symbol was the official seal of the city and its NBA basketball team and the police department that protected all. </p><p>It was the white whirling dervish against midnight blue that Deputy Chief Virginia West wore on the shoulders of her crisp white uniform shirt with all its brass. Most cops, frankly, had not a clue as to what the symbol meant. Some thought it was a tornado, a white owl, a beard. Others were certain it had to do with sports events in the coliseum or the new two-hundred-and-thirty-million-dollar stadium that hovered downtown like an alien spacecraft. But West had been stung more than once and knew exactly what the hornet's nest was about. It was what awaited her when she drove to work and read <b>The Charlotte <b>Observer</b></b> every morning. Violence swarmed, and everybody talked at once. This Monday, she was in a dark angry mood, ready to really stir things up. </p><p>The city police department recently had relocated to the new pearly concrete complex known as the Law Enforcement Center, or LEC, in the heart of downtown on Trade Street, the very road British oppressors long ago had followed into town. Construction in the area seemed endless, as if change were a virus taking over West's life. Parking at the LEC remained a mess, and she had not completely moved into her office yet. There were plenty of mud puddles and dust, and her unmarked car was new and a striking uniform blue that sent her to the carwash at least three times a week. </p><p>When she reached the reserved parking spaces in front of the LEC, she couldn't believe it. Occupying her spot was a drug dealer's set of chrome mags and parrot-green iridescent paint, a Suzuki, which she knew people flipped over in more ways than one. </p><p>"Goddamn it!" She looked around, as if she might recognize the person who had dared this perpetration. </p><p>Other cops were pulling in and out, and transporting prisoners in this constantly moving department of sixteen hundred police and unsworn support. For a moment, West sat and scanned, teased by the aroma of the Bojangles bacon and egg biscuit that by now was cold. Settling on a fifteen-minute slot in front of sparkling glass doors, she parked and climbed out, doing the best she could with briefcase, pocketbook, files, newspapers, breakfast, a large coffee. </p><p>She slammed her door shut with a hip as the dude she was looking for emerged from the building. He was jailing, jeans at low tide in that cool lockup look of six inches of pastel undershorts showing. The fashion statement got started in jail when inmates had their belts confiscated so they wouldn't hang themselves or someone else. The trend had crossed over every racial and socioeconomic line until half of the city's pants were falling off. West did not understand it. She left her car right where it was, fought with her armload as the dude mumbled good morning, trotting past. </p><p>"Brewster!" Her voice halted him like a pointed gun. "What the hell you think you're doing parking in my space!" </p><p>He grinned, flashing rings and a fake Rolex as he swept arms open wide, the pistol beneath his jacket peeking out. "Look around, Tell me what you see. Not one damn parking place in all of Charlotte." </p><p>"That's why important people like me are assigned one," she said to this detective she supervised as she tossed him her keys. "Bring them back when you've moved my car," she ordered. </p><p>West was forty-two, a woman who still turned heads and had never been married to anything beyond what she thought she was here on earth to do. She had deep red hair, a little unattended and longer than she liked it, her eyes dark and quick, and a serious body that she did not deserve, for she did nothing to maintain curves and straightness in the right places. She wore her uniform in a way that made other women want one, but that was not why she chose police blues over plain clothes. She supervised more than three hundred wiseass investigators like Ronald Brewster who needed every reminder of law and order West could muster. </p><p>Cops greeted her on her way in. She turned right, headed to offices where Chief Judy Hammer decided everything that mattered in law enforcement in this hundred-mile area of almost six million people. West loved her boss but right now didn't like her. West knew why she had been called in early for a meeting, and it was a situation beyond reason or her control. This was insane. She walked into Hammer's outer office, where Captain Fred Horgess was talking on the phone. He held his hand over the receiver and shook his head in a <b>there's nothing I can do</b> way to West as she walked up to the dark wooden door, where Hammer's name was announced brightly in brass. </p><p>"It's not good," he warned with a shrug. </p><p>"Why is it I didn't need you to tell me that?" West irritably said. </p><p>Balancing her burdens, she knocked with the toe of her Bates hi-gloss black shoe and nudged up the door handle with a knee, coffee almost spilling but caught in time. Inside, Hammer sat behind her overwhelmed desk, surrounded by framed photographs of children and grandbabies, her mission statement, <b>Prevent the Next Crime</b>, on the wall behind her. She was early fifties, in a smart houndstooth business suit, her telephone line buzzing relentlessly, but she had more important matters on her mind at the moment. </p><p>West dumped her load on one chair and sat in another one near the brass Winged Victory award the International Association of Chiefs of Police had presented to Hammer last year. She had never bothered to get a stand or give it an honored place. In fact, the trophy, which was three feet high, continued to occupy the same square of carpet next to her desk, as if waiting for a ride to someplace better. Judy Hammer won such things because she wasn't motivated by them. West removed the lid off her coffee, and steam wafted up. </p><p>"I already know what this is about," she said, "and you know what I think." </p><p>Hammer gestured to silence her. She leaned forward, folding her hands on top of her desk. "Virginia, at long last I have gotten the support of city council, the city manager, the mayor," she started to say. </p><p>"And every one of them, including you, is wrong," West said, stirring cream and sugar into her coffee. "I can't believe you've talked them into this, and I can tell you right now, they're going to find some way to screw it up because they don't really want it to happen. You shouldn't want it to happen, either. It's a damn conflict of interest for a police reporter to become a volunteer cop and go out on the street with us." </p><p>Paper crackled as West unwrapped a greasy Bojangles biscuit that Hammer would never raise to her lips, not even back in the old days when she was underweight and on her feet all day long, working the jail, juvenile division, crime analysis, records, inspections, auto theft, all those exciting assignments women got back in the days when they weren't allowed in patrol. She did not believe in fat. </p><p>"I mean, come on!" West said after a bite. "The last <b><b>Observer</b></b> cop reporter screwed us so bad you sued the newspaper." </p><p>Hammer did not like to think about Weinstein, the worthless wonder, a criminal, really, whose M. O. was to walk into the duty captain's office or the investigative division when no one was around. He stole reports right off desks, printers, and fax machines. This collaborative behavior culminated in his writing a front-page Sunday profile about Hammer, claiming she commandeered the police helicopter for personal use. She ordered off-duty cops to chauffeur her and do domestic jobs around her house. When her daughter was picked up for drunk driving, Hammer had the charges fixed. None of it was true. She did not even have a daughter. </p><p>Hammer got up, clearly frustrated and disturbed by the mess the world was in. She looked out a window, hands in the pockets of her skirt, her back to West. </p><p>"<b>The Charlotte <b>Observer</b></b>, the city, think we don't understand them or care," she starts her evangelism again. "And I know they don't understand us. Or care." </p><p>West crumpled breakfast trash, and scored two points in disgust. "All the <b><b>Observer</b></b> cares about is winning another Pulitzer Prize," she said. </p><p>Hammer turned around, as serious as West had ever seen her. "I had lunch with the new publisher yesterday. First time any of us have had a civilized conversation with anyone from there in a decade, at least. A miracle." She began her habitual pacing, gesturing with passion. She loved her mission in life. "We really want to try this. Could it blow up in our faces? Absolutely." She paused. "But what if it worked? Andy Brazil ..." </p><p>"Who?" West scowled. </p><p>Very, very determined," Hammer went on, "completed our academy for volunteers, highest marks we've ever had. Impressed the hell out of the instructors. Does that mean he won't burn us, Virginia? No, no. But what I'm not going to have is this young reporter out there screwing up an investigation, getting the wrong view of what we do. He's not going to be lied to, stonewalled, hit on, hurt." </p><p>West put her head in her hands, groaning. Hammer returned to her desk and sat. </p><p>"If this goes well," the chief went on, "think how good it could be for the department, for community policing here and around the world. How many times have I heard you say, `If only every citizen could ride just one night with us'?" </p><p>"I'll never say it again." West meant it. </p><p>Hammer leaned over her desk, pointing her finger at a deputy chief she admired and sometimes wanted to shake for thinking too small. "I want you out on the street again," she ordered. "With Andy Brazil. Give him a dose he won't forget." </p><p>"Goddamn it, Judy!" West exclaimed. "Don't do this to me. I'm up to my ears decentralizing investigations. The street crime unit's all screwed up, two of my captains out. Goode and I can't agree on anything, as usual ..." </p><p>Hammer wasn't listening. She put on reading glasses and began reviewing a memo. "Set it up today," she said. </p><p>Andy Brazil ran hard and fast. He blew out loudly, checking the time on his Casio watch as he sprinted around the Davidson College track, in the small town of the same name, north of the big city. It was here he had grown up and gone to school on tennis and academic scholarships. He had lived at the college all his life, really, in a dilapidated frame house on Main Street, across from a cemetery that, like the recently turned co-ed school, was older than the Civil War. </p><p>Until several years ago, his mother had worked in the college food service, and Brazil had grown up on the campus, watching rich kids and Rhodes scholars on their way in a hurry. Even when he was about to graduate magna cum laude, some of his classmates, usually the cheerleaders, thought he was a townie. They flirted with him as he ladled eggs and grits on their plates. They were always startled in a dense sort of way when he trotted past in a hallway, loaded with books and afraid of being late to class. </p><p>Brazil had never felt he belonged here or anywhere, really. It was as if he watched people through a pane of glass. He could not touch others no matter how hard he tried, and they could not touch him, unless they were mentors. He had been falling in love with teachers, coaches, ministers, campus security, administrators, deans, doctors, nurses since he could remember. They were accepting, even appreciative, of his unusual reflections and solitary peregrinations, and the writings he shyly shared when he visited after hours, usually bearing limeades from the M&amp;M soda shop or cookies from his mother's kitchen. Brazil, simply put, was a writer, a scribe of life and all in it. He had accepted his calling with humility and a brave heart. </p><p>It was too early for anybody else to be out this morning except a faculty wife whose lumpy shape would never be transformed by anything but death, and two other women in baggy sweats breathlessly complaining about the husbands who made it possible for them to be walking while most of the world worked. Brazil wore a <b>Charlotte <b>Observer</b></b> tee shirt and shorts, and looked younger than twenty-two. He was handsome and fierce, with cheekbones high, hair streaked blond, body firm and athletically splendid. He did not seem aware of how others reacted to the sight of him, or perhaps it didn't matter. Mostly, his attention was elsewhere. </p><p>Brazil had been writing ever since he could, and when he had looked for a job after graduating from Davidson, he had promised <b><b>Observer</b></b> publisher Richard Panesa that if Panesa would give Brazil a chance, the newspaper would not be sorry. Panesa had hired him as a <b>TV Week</b> clerk, updating TV shows and movie blurbs. Brazil hated typing in programming updates for something he did not even watch. He did not like the other clerks or his hypertensive, overweight editor. Other than a promised cover story one of these days, there was no future for Brazil, and he began going to the newsroom at four in the morning so he could have all of the updates completed by noon. </p><p>The rest of the day he would roam desk to desk, begging for garbage-picking stories the seasoned reporters wanted to duck. There were always plenty of those. The business desk tossed him the scoop on Ingersoll-Rand's newest air compressor. Brazil got to cover the <b>Ebony</b> fashion show when it came to town, and the stamp collectors, and the world championship backgammon tournament at the Radisson Hotel. He interviewed wrestler Rick Flair with his long platinum hair when he was the celebrity guest at the Boy Scout convention. Brazil covered the Coca-Cola 600, interviewing spectators drinking beer while stock cars blasted past. </p><p>He turned in a hundred hours' overtime five months in a row, writing more stories than most of Panesa's reporters. Panesa held a meeting, gathering the executive editor, managing editor, and features editor behind closed doors to discuss the idea of making Brazil a reporter when his first six months were up. Panesa couldn't wait to see Brazil's reaction, knowing he would be thrilled beyond belief when Panesa offered him general assignment. Brazil wasn't. </p></p><h2>Zoku Quick Pops Recipe Book, Perfect the Art of Popsicle Making</h2><p><p>This book will help you master the art of creating Zoku Quick Pops faster than ever!

Simultaneous.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 1-This adaptation for beginning readers tells the story in a brisk, straightforward style. The simple, colorful illustrations, most of which are on double-page spreads, initially portray a red-hooded-sweatshirt-clad Little Red Riding Hood setting off with her goodies and her mother's admonishment not to talk to strangers. Naturally, she meets the wolf, who distracts her so that he can get to Grandma's first. He swallows Grandma whole, with only her stocking feet shown disappearing down his throat. After the traditional exchange of pleasantries, Little Red suffers the same unfortunate fate. A woodcutter is shown approaching the sleeping wolf, ax upraised. The next illustration depicts the beast's hindquarters stretched out on the floor, his two victims standing unharmed beside him. The child vows never to talk to strangers again. The vocabulary is appropriate for beginning readers. The lively illustrations and familiarity of the story should provide a successful reading experience.<br><i>Lisa Smith, Lindenhurst Memorial Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ziefert and Bolam have collaborated on more felicitous projects than this clanky reworking of a familiar tale. This Easy-to-Read retelling is supposed to give fledgling readers a boost of confidence, with modest, repetitious vocabulary and short sentences, but the wording is clunky: ``I will be careful,'' says Little Red Riding Hood. ``I will not talk to strangers.'' The story can't survive such an artless distillation, in which the eating of Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood is disconcertingly antiseptic. The potential pleasure of reading is sacrificed to pure mechanics, making basal readers look like poetry. (Picture book. 4-7) -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Cohen</b> is professor of Russian studies and history at New York University and a consultant to CBS News. His books include <i>Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution</i> and <i>Sovieticus</i>.An incisive and occasionally caustic critique of American attitudes toward post-Soviet Russia.Russian expert Cohen (<i>Voices of Glasnost</i>, not reviewed) takes the reader through a decade of American policymaking that he views as nothing less than an unmitigated disaster. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, he argues, the Clinton administration, along with the majority of American scholars and journalists, has embarked on an ideological crusade, preaching the necessity of monetarist, free-market reforms and unflinchingly supporting the Yeltsin administration despite incontrovertible evidence that the reforms and the reformer have driven Russia back into the 19th century. Cohen is especially compelling in demonstrating the parallel between contemporary American "transitionologists" (those who believe Russia is in a period of "transition" to American-style free market democracy) and the Communists themselves-both have proved willing to overlook the poverty, chaos, and misery created by "shock therapy" reforms in the name of a purportedly golden future. While Cohen's argument is effectively laid out, however, it bogs down in the book's middle section, where he reprints a series of articles written since 1992. Cohen's prescience and deep understanding of Russian society are easy to glean from these pieces, but their repetitiveness soon takes on a smirking quality. The final third of the study, in which Cohen outlines a new Russia policy based on respect for Russian realities and the dangers posed by the country's nuclear arsenal, is marred by a different kind of self-importance: perhaps because he studies Russia for a living, Cohen gives it a centrality in his analysis of American policymaking that at times verges on the unbelievable. These are minor flaws, however, in an otherwise thoroughly convincing work.Unafraid to be contentious or to stand accused of nostalgia for the Soviet Union, Cohen offers a blistering, brilliant, and deeply felt critique of America's decade-long daydream of a Russia in transition. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Philip Randolph: And The African-American Labor Movement</h2><p>Traces the life of the civil rights activist who organized the labor union for Pullman car porters and crusaded for the desegregation of the armed forces.</p><p>Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Randolph lived a long, fascinating life, characterized by his single-minded drive to achieve racial equality for African Americans. In the course of 40 years, he faced down two U.S. presidents, defeated a powerful railroad company, and was the force behind the 1963 March on Washington. Miller depends heavily on existing scholarly and popular Randolph biographies. He tells the story in much the same way as it was told before, such as in Catherine Reef's <i>A. Philip Randolph: Union Leader and Civil Rights Crusader</i> (Enslow, 2001) and Lillie Patterson's <i>A. Philip Randolph: Messenger for the Masses</i> (Facts On File, 1995). Still, for readers with no knowledge of the subject, the overview approach makes Randolph and his achievements more accessible, and the book is certainly enhanced by the archival photographs of pivotal moments in the man's life and times.<i>&#x2013;Carol Jones Collins, Columbia High School, Maplewood, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 7-10. Aside from a suspect bit of legend building at the beginning (as children, if Randolph and his brother did not fight back against bullying, their mother "would whip them, for she hated cowards") and a reliance on previously published sources only, Miller lucidly traces Randolph's spectacular career while presenting a case study in the effective use of hard-nosed rhetoric and nonviolent tactics to achieve breakthroughs in the fight against segregation. Profusely illustrated with photographs, sometimes in color, and capped by resource lists, this portrait of the fiery civil rights leader will be useful in small and medium-sized libraries as a replacement or alternative for such out-of-print titles as Sally Hanley's <i>A.

However, be forewarned...once you meet Jack Reacher, you'll be hooked, so be prepared to stock up on the series. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><br> <p> </p><b>Who Is Jack Reacher? A Video from Lee Child</b><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> <b>Watch the video<b></b></b><b><b> </b></b></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><b>A Note from Lee Child</b><br><br> Two years ago I was on a book tour, promoting that year's new Jack Reacher novel, <i>One Shot</i>. One particular night, the event was held in a small town outside of Chicago. The date was June 21st. As I was giving my talk and answering questions and signing books, that date was nagging away at the back of my mind. I knew it had some significance. I started panicking--had I forgotten my anniversary? No, that's in August. My wife's birthday? No, that's in January. My own birthday? No, that's in October.<br><br> Then suddenly I remembered--it was ten years to the day since I had been fired from my previous job. That was why and how I had become a writer. That night in Illinois was a ten-year anniversary of a different sort, somewhat bittersweet.<br><br> And ten is a nice round number. So I started thinking about my old colleagues. My workmates, my buddies. We had been through a lot together. I started to wonder where they all were now. What were they doing? Were they doing well, or struggling? Were they happy? What did they look like now? Pretty soon I was into full-on nostalgia mode. Ten-year anniversaries can do that to a person. I think we all share those kind of feelings, about high school, or college, or old jobs we've quit, or old towns we've moved away from.<br><br> So I decided to make this year's Jack Reacher book about a reunion. I decided to throw him back among a bunch of old colleagues that he hadn't seen for ten years, people that he loved fiercely and respected deeply. Regular Reacher readers will know that he's a pretty self-confident guy, but I wanted him to wobble just a little this time, to compare his choices with theirs, to measure himself against them.<br><br> The renewed get-together isn't Reacher's own choice, though. And it's not a standard-issue reunion, either. Something very bad has happened, and one of his old team-members from the army contacts him, by an ingenious method (it's hard to track Reacher down). She gives him the bad news, and asks him to do something about it. He says, "Of course I'll do something about it."<br><br> "No," his friend says. "I mean, I want you to put the old unit back together."<br><br> It's an irresistible invitation. Wouldn't we all like to do that, sometimes? <i>--Lee Child</i><br><br> <b>Secrets of the Series: A Q&amp;A with Lee Child</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> Why do you think readers keep coming back to your novels?<br> <b>A:</b> Two words: Jack Reacher. Reacher is a drifter and a loner with a strong sense of justice. He shows up, he acts, he moves on. He's the type of hero who has a long literary history. Robin Hood, the Lone Ranger, Aragorn from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Jack Reacher--they're all part of the same heroic family. Reacher just ratchets it up a notch. Maybe more than a notch. Why is he so appealing? Most often people say to me it's his sense of justice; he will do the right thing. Even though there is no reward in it for him, even though there is often a high cost to be paid by him, he will always try to do the right thing and people find that reassuring in today&#x2019;s world when not too many people are doing the right thing.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Jack Reacher gets compared to James Bond, Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne, each of whom now has a "face." In a movie, which actor do you think could fill Reacher's shoes?<br> <b>A:</b> That's the toughest question. The thing about Reacher is he's huge; he&#x2019;s 6'5" tall and about 250 pounds. There aren&#x2019;t any actors that size--actors tend to be small. So we aren't going to find a physical facsimile for Reacher because there aren't any. We have to find someone who is capable of looking big on the screen. Many people have said to me a young Clint Eastwood would have been perfect--we need someone like that who has the vibe of a big intimidating man. Hopefully there will be somebody available like that. It's also a question of finding somebody ready to sign up for more than one movie. They want to make a franchise, minimum of three, and that makes it a little bit harder. <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What research is involved in writing one of your stories? <br> <b>A:</b> My research is all kind of backwards. I don't go to the public library for three months and take notes in advance; instead my best research is by remembering and adapting. I read, travel, and talk to people just for the fun of it, filing away these interesting little snippets to the back of my mind and eventually they float to the surface and get used. The problem is, I approach writing the book with the same excitement and impatience that I hope the reader is going to feel about reading it. But even so, I need a certain measure of technical intrigue in the story. There is specific research I have to do as I go along, anything that's a small detail; a car, a gun, a type of bullet. I will check that out at the time. But, that's what I call the detail--the broad stuff is the stuff I already know. <br><br> <strong>Meet Jack Reacher</strong> <table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>The Killing Floor</i></td><td> <br><i>Die Trying</i></td><td> <br><i>Tripwire</i></td><td> <br><i>Running Blind</i></td><td> <br><i>Echo Burning</i></td></tr></tbody></table> <br><br> <table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Without Fail</i></td><td> <br><i>Persuader</i></td><td> <br><i>The Enemy</i></td><td> <br><i>One Shot</i></td><td> <br><i>The Hard Way</i></td></tr> </tbody></table><br> <p></p><p><b>Lee Child&nbsp;</b>is the author of nineteen&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Jack Reacher thrillers, ten of which have reached the #1 position.

More than 100 of her black-and-white photographs, reproduced in duotone, record both the evolution of Davidson and his art, from the early days up to the present, a span of 25 years. In the accompanying text and captions, Robert Davidson writes movingly about growing up Haida and his development as an artist, describes the creative and practical process of carving poles and masks, and discusses the place of art in Haida culture. </p><br><p>An introduction by <strong>Aldona Jonaitis</strong> assesses Robert Davidson's place in the world of art. Robert Davidson has produced an internationally acclaimed body of art, in particular a number of large totem poles and masks in collections in Canada and the United States, including the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the Vancouver Art Gallery.</p></p><p><strong>Aldona Jonaitis </strong>is the author of a number of books including <em>Art of the Northwest Coast </em>and, with Aaron Glass, <em>The Totem Pole: An Intercultural History</em>. <strong>Aldona Jonaitis</strong> is the director of the Museum of the North and professor of anthropology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Previously, <strong>Jonaitis</strong> served as vice-president for public programs at the American Museum of Natural History. Her seminal books include <em>Art of the Northwest Coast</em>, <em>Chiefly Feasts</em>, <em>The Yuquot Whalers' Shrine</em> and <em>From the Land of the Totem Poles</em>. <strong>Ulli Steltzer</strong>'s photographic studies of Native peoples, Princeton intellectuals, American migrant workers and the Cakchiquel of Guatamala have been shown in major exhibitions. Her books include <em>Indian Artists at Work</em>, <em>Coast of Many Faces</em>, <em>Inuit</em>, <em>Spirit of the Haida Gwaii</em> and <em>Black Canoe</em>. <strong>Robert Davidson</strong> is a carver, sculptor, painter, printmaker and jeweller, whose work is in private and public collections internationally. He is also a student of the Haida language, culture and history, and performs Haida songs and dances as a member of the Rainbow Creek Dancers. Two books have been published on his work, <em>Robert Davidson, Haida Printmaker</em> by Hilary Stewart and <em>Robert Davidson: Eagle of the Dawn</em> edited by Ian M. Thom, in conjunction with a major retrospective of his work at the Vancouver Art Gallery.Haida artist Davidson is renowned for his work in various media, though he is best known for sculpture and printmaking that reflect his Northwest Coast heritage. While several books on Davidson are available, this publication is most valuable because it relies on his ideas rather than interpretation from others-a kind of filtration to which much writing about Native American art is too often subjected. Davidson's own words, effectively allied with Steltzer's photo documentation, give readers a strong visual survey of the artist's inspirations and achievements. Like his equally famous peer, Bill Reid, Davidson has been nurtured by a rich background of creative imagery, especially totem poles and ceremonial masks, and his comments here illuminate Haida culture and art forms. An appropriate supplement to Robert Davidson: Eagle of the Dawn (Univ. of Washington Pr., 1993) and a useful purchase for libraries covering contemporary art history, Native American culture, and Pacific Northwest regional studies.<br><i>Paula A.

Here was a versatile culinary bible, through which a generation discovered how to feel at home in the kitchen and found the confidence to experiment and adapt recipes to their own needs. This was the book to reach for when hastily organising a last-minute supper with friends, when planning a luxurious weekend lunch or contemplating a store-cupboard meal for one, or when trying to tempt a fussy toddler. This was a book about home cooking for busy lives.The chief revelation was the writing. Rather than a set of intimidating instructions, Nigellas recipes provide inspiration. She has a gift for finding the right word to spark the readers imagination, evoking the taste of the ingredients, the simple, sensual pleasures of the practical process, the deep reward of the finished dish. Passionate, trenchant, convivial and wise, Nigellas prose demands to be savoured, and ensures that the joy and value of How to Eat will endure for decades to come.How to eat, how to cook, how to write: I want two copies of this book, one to reference in the kitchen and one to read in bed Yotam Ottolenghi</p><p></p><h2>Jesus and His Times (Reader&#39;s Digest Books)</h2><p>Prepared with the help of leading Biblical scholars and illustrated with paintings of the people and their culture, photographs of the ancient lands today, and maps, this volume documents the historical background of Jesus and the key events of his life</p><p></p><h2>The Doctrine of Creation: The Command of God the Creator (Church Dogmatics, vol. 3, pt. 4)</h2><p><p>Described by Pope Pius XII as the most important theologian since Thomas Aquinas, the Swiss pastor and theologian, Karl Barth, continues to be a major influence on students, scholars and preachers today.</p><p>Barth's theology found its expression mainly through his closely reasoned fourteen-part magnum opus, Die Kirchliche Dogmatik.

Carol Cheney Rome&#39;s definitive volume thoroughly explores all aspects of Bargello, a family of needlepoint stitches that has increasingly gained in popularity since the 1500s. Bargello, also called Florentine embroidery, is characteristically worked in various repeat, shaded geometric designs. However, the Bargello stitches can also be used to make up representational or pictorial designs. After a brief historical survey, the author introduces in detail seven basic stitches that make up Bargello patterns. Following that is a large section of &#34;new-old&#34; Florentine patterns: updated, fresh-looking, but traditional versions of the Bargello theme. Four border patterns based on the classical principles are included. Then the author moves on to show how Bargello can be used in new ways to create beautiful, eye-catching patterns. Three kaleidoscopic, or four-way, patterns and two tartans are included in this section. Four animals make up the last section of designs, and the reader learns how effective pictorial designs can be when the Bargello stitches are used to fill them in. A discussion about designing your own Bargello with special emphasis on four-way patterns is, like the rest of the book, richly illustrated throughout with large photographs, and with helpful diagrams. The four full-size animal diagrams present a special bonus to the reader. Mrs. Rome has added practical &#34;how-to&#34; hints in boxes to make each person&#39;s stitching experience easier and more fun.</p><p></p><h2>Change Your Life Without Getting Out of Bed: The Ultimate Nap Book</h2><p>We all need more naps!

His breath in the closed carriage had misted over the glass at the window, and he leaned forward and rubbed at the pane with his gloved hand. It cleared the mist but the outside was thickly coated with snow, offering only an opaque square of whiteness that gave little light and no visibility. </p><p> He sat back against the thick leather squabs and sighed. The carriage was in the first style of elegance and comfort, as well sprung as such a vehicle could ever be, but after close to three weeks' traveling, Viscount Allenton found it as comfortable as a donkey cart. The snow had started in earnest as they'd left Newcastle, but now that they were lumbering through the lower reaches of the Cheviot Hills it was a blizzard. The horses were struggling to keep their footing on the sometimes steep road that for long stretches was barely a cart track winding its way through the foothills. God knows what it would be like higher up, Ned thought. The upper passes would certainly be blocked. But fortunately he was heading out of the hills, not into them. </p><p> Alnwick, a small, pretty Northumberland town. That was how he remembered it, but the last time he had visited his childhood home had been ten years ago, before he'd been packed off, the family's so-called black sheep, into exile over a scandal that struck him now as utterly stupid. Since then his blood had thinned under the Indian sun, and he couldn't seem to get warm anywhere in this godforsaken frozen north. </p><p> And if his brother, Robert, had managed to keep himself alive, Ned would still be warmly content in India's sultry heat. But Rob, as so often in their childhood, had ridden his horse blindly at a hedge during a hunt, and both horse and rider had gone down into the unseen ditch on the other side. The horse had broken both forelegs, and Rob his neck. Which left the previously contented younger son, Edward the black sheep, to inherit the family estates and the title. And the younger son infinitely preferred the life of plain Ned Vasey, Indian nabob, to that of Edward Vasey, Viscount Allenton. </p><p> But such is fate, Ned reflected, huddling closer into his greatcoat. Ten years ago the estate had been going to rack and ruin under his father's reckless negligence, and it seemed from the agent's letters that Rob had finished the job. Which left the younger son, who had somehow managed to turn his exile into a very good thing, to pick up the pieces. And a very expensive picking up it was going to be, Ned had no doubt. </p><p> The carriage shuddered as the horses stumbled on the deeply rutted and now slippery track. Stopping was not an option. They would all freeze to death, coachman, postillions, horses and all. </p><p> The carriage was still moving, but very slowly. Ned opened the door with difficulty against the crust of snow and ice, and stepped out into the blizzard. He struggled toward the coachman and the near-side postillion. "How much farther before we're out of here?" he called up, snow filling his mouth and blocking his nose. </p><p> "Hard to say, m'lord," the coachman called down, flicking his whip at the striving horses. "At this speed, it could take an hour to do a mile." </p><p> Ned swore into a gust of snow, his words snatched by the wind. </p><p> "Best get back in, sir," the coachman shouted down. "Your weight don't make no difference to the 'osses, and ye've no need to freeze yet a while." </p><p> Ned nodded and climbed back into the coach, still swearing as he realized he'd allowed himself to get frozen to the bone with no way of warming himself up again in the frigid interior. </p><p> If he ever made it to Hartley House, at least he'd find a warm welcome there. And a house bursting with Christmas revelry. Lord Hartley's bluff camaraderie and generous spirit would be a welcome antidote to what was bound to be the dank neglect of his own house. Sarah would make him a good wife.... </p><p> "Whoa...whoa, there." </p><p> The coachman's yell broke into Ned's thoughts and he reached for the door handle again as the carriage juddered to a halt. He pushed open the door and jumped down. A torch flickered just ahead on the track showing four figures, barely visible in the swirling snow, milling around an overturned gig. The pony had been released from the traces and stood blowing steam through its nostrils and stamping its hooves. </p><p> "Stay with the horses," Ned instructed over his shoulder. He plowed through the snow toward the scene. "What happened here?" </p><p> A youth turned from the group. "Pony caught a hoof in a rut, sir," he said in a broad Northumberland accent that Ned hadn't heard in ten years. To his satisfaction, however, he found that he could still understand it without difficulty. For strangers to the county, it might as well have been a foreign tongue. </p><p> Ned bent to check the pony's legs, running his hand expertly over the hocks. "I can find no damage," he said, straightening. "Why would you bring a pony out with a gig on a night like this?" </p><p> "Why would ye bring them 'osses out in a bleedin' blizzard?" the youth demanded on a clearly combative note. </p><p> Despite the snow, there had been no signs of a storm when they'd left that morning, but Ned was not about to bandy words with this insolent young man. He turned away, back to his own conveyance. </p><p> The blow to the back of his neck surprised him more than it hurt him. He stumbled to his knees in the snow and something -- no, someone -- jumped lightly onto his back, legs curling around his waist as he knelt. Hands slipped into the deep pockets of his coat, and then fingers slid inside his coat. It was all over in the blink of an eye. The slight weight left his back, and as he struggled to his feet, his assailants and the pony disappeared into the blanket of snow behind him. The gig remained where it was. Presumably it was a permanent fixture, designed to catch any unwary traveler on these seldom-used tracks. </p><p> Ned cursed his own stupidity. He knew that the Cheviots were plagued by bands of rapscallions and highwaymen; he simply hadn't expected to fall victim on such a filthy night. He dug into his pockets. He had kept a pouch with five guineas close to hand for easy distribution at roadside inns. It was gone. </p><p> "What 'appened there, m'lord? Couldn't see a thing in this." The coachman had climbed down from his box, but neither he nor the postillions had left the horses. </p><p> "Nothing much," Ned said, climbing back into the carriage, now as wet as he was cold. "Keep going." </p><p> The carriage lurched forward again and he felt inside his coat. His fob watch was gone from his waistcoat pocket. Those light fingers had demonstrated all the sleight of hand of an experienced pickpocket. He hadn't been able to see the features of any of his cloaked and hooded assailants behind the veil of snow, but he was fairly certain he would recognize the feel of those fingers against his heart. </p><p> The financial loss was no great matter, but the blow to his pride was another thing altogether. Ten years ago he wouldn't have fallen for such a trick, but his sojourn in India had clearly softened him, he thought disgustedly. He had learned how to make money, a great deal of money, but he'd lost something in the process. Something he had to retrieve if he was to assume the life of a North Country English gentleman once again. </p><p> <i>God, he was cold</i>. He could only begin to imagine what those poor buggers outside were feeling. </p><p> Something hammered on the roof. The coachman. He struggled with the frozen door again and leaned out. "What is it?" His words disappeared into the snow but the coachman, just visible on the box above him, pointed with his whip. Ned stared into the whiteness, then saw it -- a glimmer of light, flickering like a will-o'-the-wisp in the distance. </p><p> "We can't go no farther, m'lord," the coachman bellowed. "The 'osses won't make it, an' me blood's freezin'. Reckon we 'ave to try an' rouse someone." </p><p> "Agreed," Ned shouted. "I'll go ahead and see what's there. I can make better time on foot." He jumped down into snow that reached his knees. "Postillions, release the horses from the traces and lead them after me." </p><p> The two men dismounted and stumbled through the snow to the horses' heads. Ned plunged forward, still up to his knees, keeping the flickering light in his sights. And after fifteen agonizingly slow minutes the lights grew steady and close. He could hear the wheezing of the postillions behind him and the puffing of the beasts, but salvation lay just ahead. </p><p> A long driveway led up to a large stone mansion, lights pouring forth from many windows, piercing the veil of snow. The strains of music could be heard faintly as the travelers approached the flight of steps leading up to double front doors. Ned drew his greatcoat tight and dug his way up the steps to the door. He banged the big brass knocker in the shape of a gryphon's head. And he banged it again, ever conscious of his freezing horses, and the desperation of the coachman and postillions, all standing in the snow at the foot of the steps. </p><p> He heard footsteps, the wrenching of bolts, and the door opened slowly. Light and warmth poured forth. A liveried butler stood in the doorway, gazing in something approaching disbelief at this visitor. "Can I help you, sir?" </p><p> For a moment Ned was tempted to laugh at the absurdity of the question. But only for a moment. "Yes," he said curtly. "I am Viscount Allenton, on my way to Alnwick. My men and I are benighted in this blizzard, and we need shelter. I'd be grateful if you'd bring me to your master, but first send someone to direct my coachman and postillions to the stables, and then to the kitchen fire." He stepped past the man into the hall as he spoke. </p><p> "Yes...yes, of course, my lord." The butler called over his shoulder and a footman appeared. "Ensure Lord Allenton's horses are fed and watered and bedded for the night, and show his servants to the kitchen. They will be glad of supper and ale." He turned back to Ned. "May I take your greatcoat, my lord?" </p><p> Ned became aware of the growing pudd...</p></p><h2>Lovedeath</h2><p>A collection of stories explores the relationship between eroticism and horror and examines the mysteries of love and death in a dangerous world. By the author of Carrion Comfort. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>The novella is an ideal length for dark fiction: short enough to sustain mood, long enough to develop interesting characters. This fine collection of five novellas shows off Simmons&#39; range of styles: a literary tale of a man and his daughter on a scary mountainside; a Bram Stoker Award-winning horror tale about female vampires in Thailand; a semi-horrific Native American story about a young Sioux who undertakes various trials in order to become holy; a dark science fiction tale about a drug that has pernicious effects on society; and a harrowing, ambitious tale about the horrors of World War I.Five darkly erotic short novels that entwine love and death, with horror boosting the sex, by World Fantasy Award winner Simmons (Children of Night, 1992, etc.). Simmons has never been more stylish than here, with the short novel form compressing his effects and squeezing a lurid glow from each page. Best of all, each piece stands richly distinct from its companions and casually shows fearful labors of research uncommon to the horror genre, with writing of an unhackneyed freshness seldom found among the kings and queens of gore. ``Entropy's Bed at Midnight'' tells of the woes and fears of an accident-insurance investigator, his mind a library of fatalities, whose young son died in a freak driveway accident and who now watches his five- year-old daughter set forth alone on a screamer slope for sleds. ``Dying in Bangkok'' unveils a sucker-tongued female vampire in a superbly drawn Bangkok, whose Thai clients pay her to suck blood from their erections--a revenge tale whose twist would delight Poe. ``The Man Who Slept with Teeth Women'' tells of the astral initiation of an adolescent Sioux who will be the wise man of his tribe, of his need to choose a bride from lovers with teeth in their vaginas, and of his climactic penetration. ``Flashback'' is an sf story about a near-future family hooked on a drug that induces flashbacks so that one may relive high-intensity and even imaginary moments in one's life. Explosively gory, ``The Great Lover'' is a relentless tour de force that may well become a classic (along with ``Dying in Bangkok''). Drawing on poems by WW I poets and attributing them to a single poet, this works a variation of the visionary Angel of the Somme (a glowing woman whom soldiers saw walking the battlefield) and turns her into Death as a languorously sexual Pre-Raphaelite goddess whose embrace transcends life. Enduring stuff--even more memorable than Simmons's novels. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But an ill-fated decision to fight in Vietnam changes his life forever: cut off from his Native American community, he fathers a child with another woman. When he returns home a hero, he finds his tribe in conflict over the decision to hunt a whale, both a symbol of spirituality and rebirth and a means of survival. In the end, he reconciles his two existences, only to see tragedy befall the son he left behind.Linda Hogan, called our most provocative Native American writer, with "her unparalleled gifts for truth and magic" (Barbara Kingsolver), has written a compassionate novel about the beauty of the natural world and the painful moral choices humans make in it. With a keen sense of the environment, spirituality, and the trauma of war, <em>People of the Whale</em> is a powerful novel for our times.</p><p>Linda Hogan was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her novel Mean Spirit. Her other honors include an American Book Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She lives in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.Thomas Witka Just is a member of a fictional Northwest tribe with ties to the whale and the octopus. Unexpectedly, he signs up to fight in Vietnam, where he deserts the Army and forms another family. Stefan Rudnicki effectively uses his deep voice to render Thomas as a lost soul and his abandoned wife, Ruth, as the conscience of the tribe. The tribe is also lost, and when it revives the practice of whaling for the wrong reasons, a series of disasters occurs. Although Rudnicki&#39;s timing is impeccable--he slows and softens his tone with each tragedy--the overall narration is a bit overly dramatic--in the manner of reading to a child.

Mick, a scrawny, elderly man with a bulbous nose, struggled to put out a large sign advertising tonight&#x2019;s fish boil.<br>A wheezing fan teased Shilo&#x2019;s short red hair, but it did little to cool her. Her bedroom was on the second floor of an antique store. The store was not air-conditioned, nor were any of the rooms on the floor above it&#x2014;not a single window unit hummed in the entire building. (Initially, she hadn&#x2019;t expected that to be a problem, as she&#x2019;d envisioned Wisconsin a cold place . . . but in the heart of July it felt every degree as oppressive as her native Marietta, Georgia.)<br>No air-conditioning, no ceiling fan, and no swimming pool for . . . well . . . probably a light-year distant. She figured that by noon the heat would be enough to melt the rubber soles off her favorite pair of tennis shoes.<br>Still, it wasn&#x2019;t the heat that made her say she was in Hades.<br>It was her big room with its creaking wooden floor and high tin ceiling painted eggshell white.<br>It was the antique store.<br>It was Slade&#x2019;s Corners.<br>Maybe it was Wisconsin itself.<br>Her dad had died one month ago, of a heart attack the death certificate-in-triplicate read&#x2014;two days after his forty-ninth birthday and two days before her fifteenth. She hadn&#x2019;t seen her mother in eight years, not since the Tuesday afternoon that the divorce papers were served.<br>Her mother lived in Portland now, in the company of a bass clarinetist she&#x2019;d taken up with three Christmases past. She hadn&#x2019;t bothered to come to the funeral, or to call with a word or two of sympathy. Shilo&#x2019;s older brother lived in Atlanta and had a job in the Braves&#x2019; marketing department, which he&#x2019;d landed after graduating from college last year. He said he&#x2019;d love to have Shilo move in with him and his new wife, but there just wasn&#x2019;t room in the condo, especially with a baby on the way.<br>After the funeral and all the paperwork from the hospital, funeral home, and attorney was finished, Shilo&#x2019;s grandparents drove her and her three suitcases and four smallish boxes of belongings from Marietta to Slade&#x2019;s Corners. She would have rather lived in a closet at her brother&#x2019;s place than to have this big room atop a sprawling antique store in muggy, boring, don&#x2019;t-blink-or-you&#x2019;ll-surely-miss-it, No-wheres-ville, Wisconsin.<br>The antique store was the largest building in Slade&#x2019;s Corners. Three stories tall, it stretched a hundred feet across and half again that deep on a patchy grass-dotted lot, and would have been considered good-sized in most any city.<br>The town, if it could be called such, was four blocks long and a few blocks off a state highway that stretched from the shores of Lake Michigan to Beloit. In addition to the antique store, it consisted of a dozen or so aging houses; a small and relatively new tire store that rarely had customers; a white clapboard church with peeling paint; and an Irish tavern aptly named Big Mick&#x2019;s Pub.<br>The antique store was covered with shingles, like someone had bought far too many for the roof and didn&#x2019;t have anything else to do with them. The shingles were speckled gray and worn on the edges, much like the couple who owned the store&#x2014;Shilo&#x2019;s grandparents.<br>Shilo had been living with them for three endless, unbearable weeks.<br>For excitement, she&#x2019;d discovered she could hop on a rusty bike she&#x2019;d found in the garage. She&#x2019;d ride it a mile to the east to visit the dog kennel on the hill where a pleasant woman raised little white dogs that yapped incessantly. Or she could ride a few miles farther, past an orchard being plowed under to make way for new homes, and on to the bustling community of New Munster. (On a good day New Munster looked twice the size of Slade&#x2019;s Corners. It had a tiny post office with a soda machine out front; a gas station with a soda machine out front that only sold Pepsi, when someone bothered to stock it; a small grocery store with irregular hours; a beautiful Catholic church with an adjacent cemetery; and way too many taverns.)<br>Riding her bike to the west wasn&#x2019;t an option. Slade&#x2019;s Corners dead-ended in a cornfield.<br>At night Shilo either listened to music on her iPod or read. Her grandparents didn&#x2019;t have cable&#x2014;cable didn&#x2019;t exist in Slade&#x2019;s Corners&#x2014;and they didn&#x2019;t want to spend their money on a satellite dish. They had recently bought a rabbit-ear antenna&#x2014;for five dollars Grandfather was proud to say&#x2014;which they&#x2019;d set atop their too-small color TV (recently being ten years ago). Grandfather had wrapped aluminum foil around one ear, supposedly to improve the reception.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in Hades,&#x201d; she repeated.<br>Shilo hated this place more than she&#x2019;d hated anything, and she hated her mom for not caring and her dad for dying and relegating her to this second-floor room where it was so hot it was difficult to breathe.<br>Tears spilled down her freckled face and she buried her head in her hands.<br>She hadn&#x2019;t cried at her dad&#x2019;s funeral; she was too numb. Now it seemed like she cried every day, so hard that her shoulders shook and the bed jiggled from the force of her sobs.<br>&#x201c;Three years,&#x201d; she whispered when she finally came up for air. &#x201c;Only three.&#x201d;<br>In three years her &#x201c;sentence&#x201d; here would be served and she would be released. She would be eighteen and could go where she wanted and do what she wanted.<br>She had money in a trust&#x2014;it was all clearly spelled out in the will. She&#x2019;d get it on her eighteenth birthday, and then she&#x2019;d pack her three suitcases and be on her way.<br>She&#x2019;d pick a university somewhere out East, maybe North Carolina, and get a degree in history. Her father had been a history buff, passing his erudite obsession to her. She loved to peruse all of his books, which were at her brother&#x2019;s now, dog-earring the pages of the ones on ancient Egypt and George Washington and the American Revolution, disparate topics that fiercely held her interest.<br>&#x201c;Shy . . .&#x201d;<br>Shilo groaned.<br>&#x201c;Shy . . . we&#x2019;re opening!&#x201d;<br>She slipped into the bathroom and splashed water on her face, deftly avoiding the mirror. She hoped her eyes weren&#x2019;t red and wouldn&#x2019;t give her away, but she didn&#x2019;t want to look at her reflection to see for certain.<br>&#x201c;Coming, Meemaw.&#x201d;<br>She put on four silver earrings, two for each ear, and followed that with a simple gold bracelet, a pewter cross on a thin chain, and three rings on her right hand&#x2014;all given to her by her grandmother, and all antiques. Her favorite was a silver one set with a smooth piece of turquoise. Her dad had called her a magpie on more than one occasion because she wore so much jewelry.<br>She put four rings on her left hand, one a piece of clear red plastic that wrapped around her index finger like a snake. She&#x2019;d won it at a carnival in the spring, while on her first date. Two were 14-karat gold bands from her grandmother on her mom&#x2019;s side, one with two small sapphires. The last was a high school ring she wore on her thumb, the back of it wrapped with yarn to make the opening small enough so it wouldn&#x2019;t fall off.<br>The ring belonged to the boy who took her on that first date, and who gave her his ring on their eighth . . . a few days before her dad died. Dad had been furious she was &#x201c;going steady&#x201d; at her age, but he let her wear the ring nonetheless. The boy had come to her father&#x2019;s funeral, and she forgot to give the ring back to him that day. Well, she hadn&#x2019;t forgotten, but now she wished she would have returned it&#x2014;she&#x2019;d probably never see him again.<br>&#x201c;God, don&#x2019;t let me cry anymore.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shy . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Be right there, Meemaw.&#x201d;<br>Her grandparents had asked her to work in the antique store until school started; she&#x2019;d be a sophomore this year. She agreed, since there was nothing else to do in Slade&#x2019;s Corners and she felt like she owed them something because they took her in.<br>Besides, the work wasn&#x2019;t difficult. She dusted the antiques&#x2014;some of which she found pretty, waited on the infrequent customer who accidentally found the exit off the highway, and watched her grandmother take inventory and check the books. Her grandfather was always inspecting this stamp collection or that baseball card collection, dozing at his big roll-top desk as he did so.<br>Surprisingly, the days, like this one, passed quickly.<br>&#x201c;Coming to the fish boil with us? We want to get there early, Shy, before the crowd.&#x201d;<br>Shilo pretended to study the figurines on an eye-level shelf. The past two Friday nights she&#x2019;d managed to avoid the dinner ritual. The thought of boiled fish made her practically gag.<br>&#x201c;Shy . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uhm, I&#x2019;d rather not, Meemaw. I&#x2019;m not very hungry. I think I&#x2019;ll just fix myself half a sandwich and read.&#x201d;<br>Her grandmother smiled sadly and flipped the sign hanging in the front window to closed. &#x201c;Maybe next Friday, then.&#x201d;<br>Shilo nodded. &#x201c;Next Friday, Meemaw.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d come up with another excuse then.<br>A half hour later her grandparents walked across the street for dinner.<br>A moment after that, Shilo slathered peanut butter and strawberry jelly on two pieces of bread, folded them over, and devoured them. She followed those with a handful of cheese puffs, four chocolate chip cookies, and a big glass of milk. Then she borrowed a leather-covered western off the &#x201c;sale&#x201d; rack and climbed the stairs to her room.<br>She sat on the bed and looked out the window and up at the dusky sky. It had started raining shortly after the store closed. Rivulets of water, colored blue and pink by Big Mick&#x2019;s neon sign, shot through the screen and ran down to pool on the ledge; she worried that the wood might warp, but she had to keep the window open at least a little in this heat.<br>The pub had a good crowd, cars parked in front of it, and probably around back, and filling the nearby church lot. Shilo suspected there were more people in the tavern than in all of Slade&#x2019;s Corners and perhaps New Munster put together. Big Mick&#x2019;s drew nearby farmers who&#x2019;d come in from their fields, and people on their way home to bigger towns along the state highway and who appreciated the pub&#x2019;s low prices. Friday night was always busy, though for the life of her Shilo couldn&#x2019;t figure out why anyone would want to eat boiled fish.<br>Fried? Sure. She&#x2019;d been to lots of Friday night fish fries with her dad. Golden brown breaded pieces of cod or perch and tall glasses of sweet tea. Those were good memories.<br>Grilled or smoked halibut and swordfish. Yeah, she&#x2019;d had fish fixed those ways before.<br>Boiled?<br>She felt bile rising in her throat and she spun around, putting her back to the window and closing her eyes. She listened to the rain hitting the screen and the shingles, and heard the persistent honking of a distant car horn. Faint music drifted across the street from the pub, a blues piece that might have been Wynton Marsalis. Yeah, it was Wynton, wailing away on &#x201c;Thick in the South.&#x201d; Her Meemaw had probably played it on the jukebox.<br>The rain suddenly came down harder, drowning out Wynton&#x2019;s trumpet. It rat-a-tat-tatted out its own rhythm, which Shilo found oddly pleasant and soothing. For a moment she thought she heard something else . . . an unfamiliar voice.<br>Someone calling to her?<br>The light flickered in her room; that was nothing unusual. When it rained hard in Slade&#x2019;s Corners, the power often went out.<br>There! Shilo heard it again. Someone was calling, but not to her. She heard the words &#x201c;Sig . . . Sigmund.&#x201d; That had been her father&#x2019;s name. She crept to her bedroom door and peered out into the hall. The light was flickering there, too. She found a flashlight in the end closet, turned it on to make sure it worked. Then she turned it off and waited for the voice.<br>It came again moments later, so soft she wondered if she imagined it.<br>No, not her imagination.<br>&#x201c;Sig . . . it is time.&#x201d;<br>It wasn&#x2019;t Meemaw&#x2019;s or Grandfather&#x2019;s voice. The tone was low and almost sultry, sounding whiskey-tinged like it could have belonged to a woman jazz singer. Shilo was intrigued and wanted to hear more. The voice might belong to someone from Slade&#x2019;s Corners, someone who&#x2019;d come in downstairs&#x2014;her grandparents didn&#x2019;t always lock the doors&#x2014;someone who was looking for her father. But Slade&#x2019;s Corners was so absolutely teeny that anyone in it would know that her father was resting in peace in Marietta. Too, they would know that the antique store was closed.<br>&#x201c;Sigurd Clawhand . . .&#x201d;<br>Sigurd?<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Sigurd?&#x201d; she whispered.<br>So the mysterious voice was not calling to her father after all, but to someone she&#x2019;d never heard of. And it wasn&#x2019;t coming from downstairs in the antique shop like she&#x2019;d first thought. It was coming from above her.<br>The lights went out and a shiver passed down her spine.&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2007 by the Estate of Andre Norton and by Jean Rabe.

He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.<i>May the hearthstone of hell be his bed rest forever!</i> <i>&#x2014;Old Irish Curse</i> <br> <br>It was an ordinary gray British Ford, the spartan economy model with right-hand drive customary in Ireland. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill would remember the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered right arm resting on the car&#x2019;s windowsill in the cloud-filtered light of that Dublin afternoon. A nightmare capsule of memory, it excluded everything else in the scene; just the car and that arm. Several other surviving witnesses commented on a crumpled break in the Ford&#x2019;s left front wing. The break had begun to rust. Speaking from her hospital bed, one witness said: &#x201c;The break was a jagged thing and I was afraid someone would be cut if they brushed against it.&#x201d; Two of those who recalled seeing the car come out of Lower Leeson Street knew the driver casually, but only from his days in postal uniform. He was Francis Bley, a retired postman working part-time as a watchman at a building site in Dun Laoghaire. Bley left for work early every Wednesday, giving himself time to run a few errands and then pick up his wife, Tessie. On that one day each week, Tessie spent the morning doing &#x201c;light secretarial&#x201d; for a betting shop in King Street. It was Tessie&#x2019;s habit to spend the rest of the day with her widowed sister who lived in a remodeled gatehouse off the Dun Laoghaire bypass &#x201c;just a few minutes out of his way.&#x201d; This was a Wednesday. May 20. Bley was on his way to pick up Tessie. The Ford&#x2019;s left front door, although appearing undamaged by the accident that had crumpled the wing, still required a twist of wire around the doorpost to keep it closed. The door rattled every time the car hit a bump. &#x201c;I heard it rattling when it turned onto St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South,&#x201d; one&nbsp;witness said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s own mercy I wasn&#x2019;t at the Grafton corner when it happened.&#x201d; Bley turned right off St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South, which put him on St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green West, hugging the left lane as he headed for Grafton Street. There were better routes for him to make his connection with Tessie, but this was &#x201c;his way.&#x201d; &#x201c;He liked to see all the people,&#x201d; Tessie said. &#x201c;God rest him, that&#x2019;s what he said he missed most when he quit the postal&#x2014;all the people.&#x201d; Bley, slight and wrinkled, had that skin-stretched cadaverous look that is common among certain aged Celts from the south of Ireland. He wore a soiled brown hat almost the exact shade of his patched sweater, and he drove with the patient detachment of someone who came this way often. And if the truth were known, he rather liked being slowed by the heavy traffic. It had been cold and wet through most of spring and, while it was still cloudy, the cloud cover had thinned and there was a feeling that there might be a break in the weather. Only a few of the pedestrians carried umbrellas. The trees of St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green on Bley&#x2019;s right were in full leaf. As the Ford inched along in the congested traffic, the man watching for it from a fourth-floor window of the Irish Film Society Building nodded once in satisfaction. <i>Right on time.</i> Bley&#x2019;s Ford had been selected because of this Wednesday punctuality. There was also the fact that Bley did not garage his car where he and Tessie lived in Davitt Road. The Ford was parked outside beside a thick yew hedge, which could be approached from the street along a path shielded by a parked van. There had been a van parked in this covering position the previous night. Neighbors had seen it but no one had thought to comment at the time. &#x201c;There were often vehicles parked in that place,&#x201d; one said. &#x201c;How were we to know?&#x201d; The watcher at the Film Society Building had many names but he had been born Joseph Leo Herity. He was a small, solidly fleshy man with a long, thin face and pale, almost translucent skin. Herity wore his blond hair combed straight back and hanging almost to the collar. His light brown eyes were deeply set and he had a pugged nose with prominent nostrils from which hair protruded. From his fourth-floor vantage, Herity commanded an overview of the entire setting for the drama he was about to ignite. Directly across from him, the tall trees of the green formed a verdant wall enclosing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. The Robert Emmet statue stood opposite his window and, to the left of it, there was a black-on-white sign to the public toilets. Bley&#x2019;s Ford had stopped with the traffic just to the left of Herity&#x2019;s window. A&nbsp;white tour bus with blue-and-red stripes down its side loomed over the small Ford. Traffic fumes were thick even at the fourth-floor level. Herity checked Bley&#x2019;s license number to be certain.&nbsp; <i>Yes&#x2014;JIA-5028</i>. Then there was the crumpled left front wing. The traffic began to inch forward, then stopped once more. Herity glanced left at the Grafton Street corner. He could see the signs of the Toy World shop and the Irish Permanent Society on the ground floor of the red brick building soon to be taken over by the Ulster Bank. There had been some protest about that, one ragged march with a few signs, but it had died out quickly. The Ulster Bank had powerful friends in the government. <i>Barney and his lot,</i>&nbsp;Herity thought.&nbsp; <i>They think we&#x2019;re ignorant of their scheme to make a peace with the Ulster boys!</i> Again, Bley&#x2019;s Ford inched toward the corner, but once more was stopped. There was heavy foot traffic where Grafton took off from St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. A bald-headed man in a dark blue suit had stopped almost directly beneath Herity&#x2019;s window and was examining the cinema marquee. Two young men pushing bicycles threaded their way past the bald-headed man. The traffic remained stopped. Herity looked down at the top of Bley&#x2019;s car. So innocent-looking, that car. Herity had been one of the two-man team to emerge from the yewshrouded van near Bley&#x2019;s parking spot the previous night. In Herity&#x2019;s hands had been a molded plastic package, which they had attached like a deformed limpet under Bley&#x2019;s car. At the core of that package lay a tiny radio receiver. The transmitter sat on the windowsill in front of Herity. A small black metal rectangle, it had a thin wire antenna and two recessed toggle switches&#x2014;one painted yellow, the other red. Yellow armed it, red transmitted. A glance at his wristwatch told Herity that they were already five minutes past Zero Time. Not Bley&#x2019;s fault. It was the blasted traffic. &#x201c;You can set your bloody watch by Bley,&#x201d; the leader of their selection team had said. &#x201c;The old bastard should be running a tram.&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;re his politics?&#x201d; Greaves had asked. &#x201c;Who cares about his politics?&#x201d; Herity had countered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfect and he&#x2019;ll be dying for a grand cause.&#x201d; &#x201c;The street&#x2019;ll be full of people,&#x201d; Greaves had said. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;ll be tourists sure as hell is full of Brits.&#x201d; &#x201c;We warned&#x2019;em to stop the Ulster boys,&#x201d; Herity had said.&nbsp; <i>Greaves could be an old woman sometimes!</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;They know what to expect when they don&#x2019;t listen to us.&#x201d; It was settled then. And now Bley&#x2019;s car was inching once more toward the Grafton Street corner, toward the mass of pedestrians, including the possible tourists. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, his wife, Mary, and their five-year-old twins, Kevin and Mairead, could have been classified as tourists, although John expected to be six months in Ireland while completing the research called for under his grant from the Pastermorn Foundation of New Haven, Conn. &#x201c;An Overview of Irish Genetic Research.&#x201d; He thought the title pompous, but it was only a cover. The real research was into the acceptance of the new genetics by a Roman Catholic society, whether such a society had taken a position to cope with the explosive potentials in molecular biology. The project was much on his mind that Wednesday morning but necessary preparations required his attention. High on his list was the need to transfer funds from America to the Allied Irish Bank. Mary wanted to go shopping for sweaters &#x201c;to keep our darlings warm of an evening.&#x201d; &#x201c;There y&#x2019; go,&#x201d; John teased as they left the Sherbourne Hotel, stepping into the rush of tourists and businessmen. &#x201c;Only four days in Ireland and already you sound like a local.&#x201d; &#x201c;And why not?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;And both my grandmothers from Limerick.&#x201d; They laughed, drawing a few curious stares. The children tugged at Mary, anxious to be off shopping. Ireland suited Mary, John thought. She had pale clear skin and dark blue eyes. Jet-black hair&#x2014;&#x201c;Spanish Hair,&#x201d; her family called it&#x2014;framed her rather round face. A sweet face. Irish skin and Irish features. He bent and kissed her before leaving. It brought a blush to her face but she was pleased at his show of affection and she gave him a warm smile as they parted. John walked away briskly, humming to himself, amused when he recognized the tune: &#x201c;Oh What a Beautiful Mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d; John&#x2019;s Wednesday appointment for &#x201c;transfer of foreign funds&#x201d; was at two P.M. at the Allied Irish Bank, Grafton and Chatham streets. There was a sign just inside the bank&#x2019;s entrance, white letters on black: &#x201c;Non Branch Customers Upstairs.&#x201d; A uniformed guard led him up the stairs to the office of the bank manager, Charles Mulrain, a small, nervous man with tow-colored hair and pale blue eyes behind gold-framed glasses. Mulrain had a habit of touching the comers of his mouth with a forefinger, first left side then right, followed by a quick downward brush of his dark tie. He made a joke about having his office on the first floor, &#x201c;what you Americans call the second floor.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is confusing until you catch on,&#x201d; John agreed. &#x201c;Well!&#x201d; A quick touching of lips and tie. &#x201c;You understand that we&#x2019;d normally do this at our main office, but &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;When I called, they assured me it was &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;As a convenience to the customer,&#x201d; Mulrain said. He lifted a folder from his desk, glanced inside it, nodded. &#x201c;Yes, this amount &#x2026; if you&#x2019;ll make&nbsp;yourself comfortable here, I&#x2019;ll just get the proper forms and be right back.&#x201d; Mulrain left, giving John a tight smile at the door. John went to the window and pulled back a heavy lace curtain to look down on Grafton Street. The sidewalks were thick with people all the way up to the arched gateway into St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green two short blocks up Grafton. The motor traffic was two abreast filling the street and crawling along toward him. There was a workman cleaning the parapet on the roof of the shopping center diagonally across the street&#x2014;a white-coated figure with a long-handled brush. He stood outlined against a row of five chimney pots. Glancing at the closed door of the manager&#x2019;s office, John wondered how long Mulrain would be. Everything was so damned formal here. John looked at his watch. Mary would arrive with the children in a few minutes. They planned to have tea, then John would walk down Grafton to Trinity College and begin work at the college library&#x2014;the real start of his research project. Much later, John would look back on those few minutes at the bank manager&#x2019;s &#x201c;first-floor&#x201d; window and think how another sequence of events had been set in motion without his knowledge, an inescapable thing like a movie. film where one frame followed another without ever the chance to deviate. It all centered around Francis Bley&#x2019;s.old car and a small VHF transmitter in the hands of a determined man watching from an open window that looked down on that corner where Grafton met St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Bley, patient as always, eased along at the traffic&#x2019;s pace. Herity, in his window vantage point, toggled the arming switch of his transmitter, making sure the antenna wire dangled out over the sill. As he neared the Grafton corner, the crush of pedestrians forced Bley to stop and he missed the turn of the traffic light. He heard the tour bus gain clear of traffic off to his right, trundling off in a rumble of its heavy diesel. Barricades were being erected on the building to his left and a big white-onred sign had been raised over the rough construction: &#x201c;This Building to be Remodeled by G. Tottenham Sons, Ltd.&#x201d; Bley looked to his right and noted the tall blue-and-white Prestige Cafeteria sign, feeling a small pang of hunger. The pedestrian isthmus beside him was jammed with people waiting to cross over to St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green and others struggling to make a way through the cars stopped on Grafton and blocking Bley&#x2019;s path. The crush of pedestrians was particularly heavy around Bley&#x2019;s car, people passing both front and back. A woman in a brown tweed coat, a white parcel clutched under her right elbow and each hand grasping a hand off a small child, hesitated at the right front corner of Bley&#x2019;s car while she sought an opening through the press of people. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, standing at the bank manager&#x2019;s window, recognized Mary. He saw her first because of her familiar tweed coat and the way she carried her head, that sleek cap of jet hair. He smiled. The twins were&nbsp;screened from him by the hurrying adults but he knew from Mary&#x2019;s stance that she held the children&#x2019;s hands. A brief break in the throng allowed John a glimpse of the top of Kevin&#x2019;s head and the old Ford with the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered elbow protruding. <i>Where is that damned bank manager?</i>&nbsp;John wondered.&nbsp; <i>She&#x2019;ll be here any minute</i>. He dropped the heavy lace curtain and looked once more at his wristwatch. Herity, at the open window above and behind Bley, nodded once more to himself. He stepped back away from the window and toggled the second switch on his transmitter. Bley&#x2019;s car exploded, ripped apart from the bottom. The bomb, exploding almost under Bley&#x2019;s feet, drove him upward with a large piece of the car&#x2019;s roof, his body crushed, dismembered and scattered. The large section of roof sailed upward in a slow arc to come crashing onto the Irish Permanent Society Building, demolishing chimney pots and slates. It was not a large bomb as such things went, but it had been expertly placed. The old car was transformed into jagged bits of metal and glass&#x2014;an orange ball of fire peppered with deadly shrapnel. A section of the car&#x2019;s bonnet decapitated Mary O&#x2019;Neill. The twins became part of a bloody puddle blown against the iron fencing across the street at St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Their bodies were more easily identified later because they were the only children of that age in the throng. Herity did not pause to glance out at his work; the sound told it all. He tucked the transmitter into a small and worn military green pack, stuffed an old yellow sweater onto it, strapped the cover and slung the pack over his shoulder. He left the building by the back way, elated and satisfied. Barney and his group would get this message! John O&#x2019;Neill had looked up from his wristwatch just in time to see the orange blast envelop Mary. He was saved from the window&#x2019;s shattered glass by the heavy curtains, which deflected all but one of the shards away from him. One small section of glass creased his scalp. The shock wave staggered him, driving him backward against a desk. He fell sideways, momentarily unconscious but getting quickly to his knees as the bank manager rushed into the room, shouting: &#x201c;Good God! What was that?&#x201d; John stumbled to his feet, rejecting the question and the answer that rumbled through his head like an aftershock of the blast. He brushed past the bank manager and out the door. His mind remained in shock but his body found its way down the stairs. He shouldered a woman aside at the foot of the stairs and lurched out onto the street where he allowed himself to be carried along by the crowd rushing toward the area of the blast. There was a smell of burnt iron in the air and the sound of cries and screams. Within only a few seconds John was part of a crush being held back by police and uninjured civilians pressed into service to keep the area around the explosion clear. John elbowed and clawed his way forward. &#x201c;My wife!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I saw her. She was there. My wife and our ...</p><h2>A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government</h2><p>In his first major work since Lincoln at Gettysburg, the author blames American&#39;s long-standing mistrust of government on a misreading of history, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the Founding Fathers. Tour.</p><p>Nothing may be more American than distrust of government, but Garry Wills says there is something deeply wrong with this tradition. "It is a tradition that belittles America," he writes, "that asks us to love our country by hating our government, that turns our founding fathers into unfounders, that glamorizes frontier settlers in order to demean what they settled, that obliges us to despise the very people we vote for." Although <i>A Necessary Evil</i> is full of historical references, it is plainly motivated by contemporary politics: "I began this book in 1994, when the fear of government manifested itself in the off-year election of a Republican majority to Congress." Wills writes at length about matters such as the republic's founding, the 19th-century debate over states' rights, and so on. Yet the most passionate and engaging sections focus on antigovernment attitudes today, as embodied by the term-limits movement (the founders, he says, never were opposed to professional politicians), the National Rifle Association (whose defense of gun-ownership rights, Wills believes, is ahistorical), and abortion-clinic bombings (which Wills unpersuasively blames on Ronald Reagan). In his conclusion, Wills argues that government is in fact "a necessary good." It may do things poorly from time to time, and it may even do great harm. "But," to draw a parallel, "when marriages fail, we do not think it is because marriage is an evil in itself." <i>A Necessary Evil</i> is an erudite treatment of an important subject. <i>--John J.

To feel your body cry out for nourishment, to think only of food? How many fitful, hungry nights must pass before dreams of home-cooked meals metastasize into nightmares of cannibalism? Why would anyone volunteer to find out? <br><br> In <i>The Great Starvation Experiment,</i> historian Todd Tucker tells the harrowing story of thirty-six young men who willingly and bravely faced down profound, consuming hunger. As conscientious objectors during World War II, these men were eager to help in the war effort but restricted from combat by their pacifist beliefs. So, instead, they volunteered to become guinea pigs in one of the most unusual experiments in medical history -- one that required a year of systematic starvation. <br> <br> Dr. Ancel Keys was already famous for inventing the K ration when the War Department asked for his help with feeding the starving citizens of Europe and the Far East at the war's end. Fascists and Communists, it was feared, could gain a foothold in war-ravaged areas. "Starved people," Keys liked to say, "can't be taught Democracy." The government needed to know the best way to rehabilitate those people who had been severely underfed during the long war. To study rehabilitation, Keys first needed to create a pool of starving test subjects. <br> <br> Gathered in a cutting-edge lab underneath the football stadium at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Keys' test subjects forsook most food and were monitored constantly so that Dr. Keys and his scientists could study the effects of starvation on otherwise healthy people. While the weight loss of the men followed a neat mathematical curve, the psychological deterioration was less predictable. Some men drank quarts and quarts of water to fill their empty stomachs. One man chewed as many as forty packs of gum a day. One man mutilated himself to escape the experiment. Ultimately only four of the men were expelled from the experiment for cheating -- a testament to the volunteers' determination and toughness. <br> <br> To prevent atrocities of the kind committed by the Nazi doctors, international law now prevents this kind of experimentation on healthy people. But in this remarkable book, Todd Tucker captures a lost sliver of American history -- a time when cold scientific principles collided with living, breathing human beings. Tucker depicts the agony and endurance of a group of extraordinary men whose lives were altered not only for the year they participated in the experiment, but forever.</p><p><b>Todd Tucker</b> received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Notre Dame and served as an officer with the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine force.

With practiced efficiency, Subject Number 20 stood, stepped away from the table, and silently walked outside. His "buddy" -- a designated supervisor required to accompany him outside the lab at all times -- had taken him to their friends' house in Minneapolis several times over the course of the experiment. It was the home of two elderly ladies who had somehow come to befriend the corps of test subjects. While he couldn't eat their food, just getting out of the lab and talking to people unconnected to the experiment was invigorating. At least it had been at first.</p><p>During these furloughs, Number 20 had gotten into the habit of chopping wood in the backyard until the meal was done, the dishes were put away, and the temptation to cheat and steal a morsel of food had passed. And there had been cheaters. The lapses were all too easily detected when a volunteer's weight loss suddenly veered from the predictive curve carefully drawn by Dr. Ancel Keys. Those incidents led to immediate dismissal from the experiment, stern talks from the doctor, and the implementation of new layers of supervision. Everyone knew who they were, the cheaters, the men not tough enough to finish the experiment. Number 20 had seen the shame in their eyes; he had joined in the pitying glances and the whispered reproaches. He refused to become one of them. But he still chopped wood during dinner. He knew the limits of his willpower.</p><p>In the early days, as the food was served inside without him, he would chop giant stacks of timber in the moonlight -- sweating, chopping, congratulating himself on the strength of his character with each fall of the ax. Now, after months of starvation, his efforts were a farce, a charade of a strong young man helping out two widows with their chores. Either old lady could probably have picked him up and carried him across the yard. Number 20 wondered if he had strength enough to swing the ax a single time. Besides the general weakness that accompanied his malnourishment, he had also mangled a finger on his left hand the week before. It throbbed painfully. He watched the moonlight reflect on the ax's shiny blade as he walked to the woodpile.</p><p>The experiment was in the rehabilitation phase -- the hard part was supposed to be over. Yet even with the starvation phase complete, the scientists controlled every bite of food in his diet, as they had for the past nine months. The volunteers who remained had been divided into four recovery groups, and each group was given incrementally more food than they had been allowed during the starvation phase. As luck would have it, Subject No. 20 suspected he was in the lowest group and, thus, given only 400 more calories a day than he had been allowed during starvation. The difference was almost imperceptible. It was a crushing disappointment after nine months of counting the hours to "R1," the day he thought he would be allowed to eat again.</p><p>The difference for his group amounted to about two slices of tasteless soy bread a day, in addition to the smattering of turnips and cabbage they were now accustomed to. He wasn't even gaining weight; in fact, he was still losing weight -- which, the doctors explained, was actually his body recovering from starvation: the fluid retention caused by edema was going away faster than he could regain healthy tissue. That reasoning did nothing to cheer him up as he continued to think about food to the exclusion of all else. On good nights, he dreamt of feasts, giant steaming tables piled high with ham, potatoes, bread, and pie. On bad nights he startled himself awake with horrifying nightmares of cannibalism, wiping his mouth to see if it was dripping with blood. As he caught his breath in the gray darkness of the barracks, he would listen to the groans and the raspy, shallow snores of his friends who were suffering through tortured dreams of their own. The prospect of another three months in the lab was unbearable.</p><p>He split a log cleanly, and watched the two halves fall dumbly apart. Just that one swing of the ax exhausted him; he paused to catch his breath. He heard with sharp clarity his friends laughing inside, heard their forks scraping their plates -- the scientists had confirmed a piece of folklore that said hearing improved with starvation. Was it dessert, Number 20 wondered, a freshly baked pie or a scoop of ice cream? Or were they still lingering over pot roast and gravy? He imagined slicing through the tender meat with a silver knife, feeling the blade cut cleanly until it scraped the china, soaking up gravy with a slice of warm bread, washing it all down with cold milk.</p><p>He could quit at any time, of course -- several men had. He was supposed to be stronger than that, a leader of the group. He was supposed to be suffering for his pacifist beliefs, while at the same time benefiting mankind in the study of starvation and rehabilitation. Men were dying overseas in the war. Friends of his were in the fight. Hitler had starved millions. How would Number 20 be able to say that he had been not only unwilling to serve alongside the troops, but also too weak to even complete a science experiment? He knew that for the rest of his life, people were going to ask him what he did during the war. The starvation experiment was his opportunity to give an honorable answer to that question. How could he quit?</p><p>So he had stuck with it, feeling colder, fainter, thinner, and hungrier each day. When he caught a bad cold, Number 20 found himself hoping it would get worse. For days he searched his tired body for symptoms of tuberculosis...to no avail. He had begun to think of the hospital, with its starchy meals, as his deliverance, an honorable alternative to quitting or expulsion.</p><p>Just a week before, Number 20 dropped his car on his hand. He had jacked up his old Packard in the stadium parking lot, pretended to do some maintenance, and then pulled the pin on the jack as he set his left hand on the ground. He flinched, pulled his hand out at the last instant. He had only crushed a finger, and not badly enough to be removed from the study. The doctors were suspicious, of course, and would have yanked him from the experiment in a second if they had thought him suicidal or psychotic. He insisted convincingly that it was an accident. They took him to the hospital, but continued to bring him carefully measured meals from the laboratory's kitchen. He loathed himself for losing his nerve, and wondered if he would get another chance to fake a believable accident.</p><p>Subject No. 20 knelt on the ground of their friends' yard and stood up one of the logs he was to split. It had a smooth, flat surface, as smooth and level as a small table. He splayed the fingers of his left hand across the flat top of the log and looked at them. Like everything else on his body, they looked alien to him now. His knuckles bulged on spidery, thin fingers. His pale skin was blue in the moonlight. One blackened fingernail reminded him of his last pathetic attempt. With his right hand, Number 20 raised the ax into the air. He had to grip the handle about halfway up to put the blade in range. He barely had the strength to hold the ax, and wondered seriously if he could bring it down with enough power to do any damage. He thought about three more months of hunger, three more months of scientists prodding his body and psychologists probing his mind, with Dr. Keys watching somberly in the background, making notes on his clipboard, raising an occasional eyebrow at the graphs of the psychological inventory.</p><p>Number 20 pulled the ax down with a grunt and what remained of his strength. The blade came down straight and true. Before he passed out, Subject No. 20 watched with satisfaction as three of his fingers rolled off the log and into the neatly mown grass.</p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by Todd Tucker</p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Eat Right to Keep Fit : A Practical Guide To Nutrition Designed To Help You Achieve Good Health Through Proper Diet</h2><p>Guide to the principles of nutrition designed to help the normal adult attain maximum health through proper diet</p><p>She was born in Lizton, Indiana on February 25, 1904.

Full-color photographs and step-by-step instructions clearly explain each activity, so that kids can make the most of the machines with minimal help from adults. Part of the Starting with Science series, Simple Machines encourages children to have fun as they learn basic science and fills a need for primary-level science resources.</p><p>Deborah Hodge is a former educational consultant and curriculum designer and the author of the Kids Can Press Wildlife series. She lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.<p>Gr 2-4--Using primary background colors and attractive, enthusiastic children as models, the format of this series is spacious and packs visual punch. Each book contains 13 experiments that are clearly explained in the full-color photographs and step-by-step directions. The texts are set in blocks that list the materials needed, the methodology, and an explanation of the principle shown. In Simple Machines, the lever, wheel, wheel and axle, gears, pulleys, inclined plane, screw, and combinations of basic machines are explored. One activity involves moving a friend lying on a table by using a broomstick placed over a wooden chair as a lever and fulcrum, which could be problematic. In Solids, Liquids and Gases, the properties of matter are explained using common experiments such as making ice cream. In general, safety precautions are indicated in the text or illustrated in the photographs. Expansions of each activity are included in an appendix. These lively titles are far more attractive than Anne Horvatic's Simple Machines (Dutton, 1989; o.p.) and more interactive than Michael Dahl's "Early Reader Science: Simple Machines" (Bridgestone, 1996).</p><p><i>Kathryn Kosiorek, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH</i></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Galileo&#39;s Daughter - A Historical Memoir Of Science, Faith, And Love</h2><p>&#34;As much a tale of intrigue as it is of science. . . .

An only child raised in a Catholic middle-class family in suburban Maryland, Duffy sees the 1962 death of his mother&#x2014;essentially by medical malpractice&#x2014; as what pushed him to be a writer. Duffy graduated from the University of Maryland in 1973, and has hitchhiked twice across the United States, worked construction, washed dishes, hopped freight trains with hoboes, and reported stories that have taken him to Haiti, Bosnia, and Taliban Afghanistan.

He lives in Maryland.<br><br></p>Improbable as it may seem, this long, sometimes complex first novel featuring the influential Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and his colleagues/friends/rivals, Cambridge philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, is abundant with life and almost unflaggingly interesting. Deviating only when it must from the record, the lightly fictionalized work progresses chronologically through the convolutions of Wittgenstein's career: his early life in Austria; his arrival in Cambridge; his experiences in the first World War; his unhappy memories of his brilliantly gifted older brothers, both homosexual, both suicides; his relations with a rich, powerful, autocratic father; and his succession of young male friends. All the while Russell is reeling from Lady Ottoline Morrell (of Bloomsbury fame) to a series of wives and other wandering women and the good Moore, already far from young, is marrying happily. The enigmatic Wittgenstein could imagine the unimaginable, but never would he have imagined it possible that he would one day appear as the protagonist of a noveland a delightful one, at that. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Beforelife</h2><p>In this stunning collection, Franz Wright chronicles the journey back from a place of isolation and wordlessness. After a period when it seemed certain he would never write poetry again, he speaks with bracing clarity about the twilit world that lies between madness and sanity, addiction and recovery. Wright negotiates the precarious transition from illness to health in a state of skeptical rapture, discovering along the way the exhilaration of love--both divine and human--and finding that even the most battered consciousness can be good company. <br><br>Whether he is writing about his regret for the abortion of a child, describing the mechanics of slander ("I can just hear them on the telephone and keening all their kissy little knives"), or composing an ironic ode to himself ("To a Blossoming Nut Case"), Wright's poems are exquisitely precise. Charles Simic has characterized him as a poetic miniaturist, whose "secret ambition is to write an epic on the inside of a matchbook cover." Time and again, Wright turns on a dime in a few brief lines, exposing the dark comedy and poignancy of his heightened perception. <br><br>Here is one of the poems from the collection:<br>Description of Her Eyes<br><br>Two teaspoonfuls,<br>and my mind goes<br><i>everyone can kiss my ass now</i>--<br><br>then it's changed,<br>I change my mind.<br><br>Eyes so sad, and infinitely kind.</p><p>Franz Wright, the son of the poet James Wright, was born in Vienna in 1953 and grew up in the Northwest, the Midwest, and northern California.
